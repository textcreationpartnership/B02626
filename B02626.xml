            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, ſeeing my little Sermon of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſome few yeeres ſince publiſhed, hath been ſo well accepted of I have for thy further good publiſhed this Dialogue, being the third fruit of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: wiſhing it the like ſucceſſe, that God thereby may have the glory, &amp; thou, who are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, comfort I have in one part of this Dialogue produced ſome of the ancient Writers, and ſome of the wiſe Heathen alſo, to teſtifie upon their oath in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and to bear witneſſe of the ouglineſſe of ſome vices, which we in this age make light of: which I wiſh may not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to any. In other parts of this work I do in a manner relinquiſh them. But in this caſe I have in my weake judgement thought them to be of ſome good uſe, to
<pb facs="tcp:175199:6"/> ſhew forth thus much, That if we doe not in time repent, forſake our ſinnes, and ſeek after God, both the ancient Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (whoſe eys ſaw not that we ſee, nor their ears heard what we hear) yea, the very Heathen alſo ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt us. Let none therefore ſtumble at it. But if any man do, let him remember, I am in a Dialogue, not in a Sermon. I write to all of all ſorts; I ſpeak not of ſome few of one ſort. But that which is done herein is not much more then that of the Apoſtle, (<hi>As ſome of your owne Poets have ſaid, Acts</hi> 17.) which is warrantable. One thing, dear Chriſtian, I pray thee, let me beg of thee; to wit, that thou wouldeſt not read two or three leaves of this book, and ſo caſt it from thee; but that thou wouldeſt read it throughout, even to the end. For I doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, if there be any thing in it worth the reading, it is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the latter part thereof, and

For this Dialogue hath in it, not the nature of a Tragedy, which is begun with joy, and ended with ſorrow: but a Comedy, which is begun with ſorrow, &amp; ended with joy. This book meddleth not at all with any controverſies in the Church, or any thing in the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, but onely entreth into a controverſie with Sathan and ſin. It is contrived into ſix principall heads: Firſt, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mans miſery in nature, with the means of recovery. Secondly, it ſharply inveigheth againſt the iniquity of the time, &amp; common corruptions of the world. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſheweth the marks of the children of God, and of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; together with the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſigns of Salvation and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Fourthly, it declareth
<pb facs="tcp:175199:8"/> how hard a thing it is to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, and how few ſhall enter. Fifthly, it layeth open the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the world, with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the ſame. Laſt of all, it publiſheth and proclaimeth the ſweet promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, with the abundant mercies of God to all that repent beleeve, and truely turn unto him. The Author of all bleſſing give a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto it. The God of peace, which brought againe from the dead our Lord Jeſus, the great Shepherd of the ſheep, through the bloud of the everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, make us perfect in all good works, ſanctifie us thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, amend all our imperfections, and keepe us blameleſſe untill the day of his moſt glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.

               <p>Not ſo: For the reliques and remnants of our old nature, which the Scripture calleth the old man, do hang about us, and dwell in us even untill our dying day; as it is plainly proved in the ten laſt verſes of the ſeventh to the <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>Yea: for the new creature, or new work of grace can never be fully faſhioned in this life, but is alwayes in faſhioning. And as our faith &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this life are unperfect; ſo is our regeneration and ſanctification.</p>

               <p>No, that is not my meaning: but this, that they be joyned &amp; mingled together (as I ſaid) in and throughout the whole man. For the mind or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding part is not one part fleſh, and another part ſpirit; but the whole mind is fleſh, and the whole mind is ſpirit, partly one, and partly another.

And you muſt note, that as there be ſome infirmities in Gods children, which hee correcteth with temporall chaſtiſements, and yet rewardeth their faith, love, and inward ſervice and obedience with eternal life; ſo there be ſome good things in the wicked, and them that are without Chriſt, which God rewardeth with temporall bleſſings, and yet puniſheth them eternally for their unbeliefe and hardneſſe of heart.</p>

               <p>Yes ſurely: for there is no pride worſe or more dangerous then that. Beware, ſaith one, of ſpirituall pride: as to be proud of our learning, wit, knowledge, reading, writings, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, praiers, godlineſs, policy, valour, ſtrength, riches, honour, birth, beauty, authority. For God hath not given ſuch gifts unto men, to the end they ſhould make ſale-ware of them, and ſet them a ſun-ſhining to behold; ſeeking only themſelves with their gifts, the vain praiſe of the multitude, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the people: ſo robbing God of his honour, and proudly arrogating to themſelves that which is due unto God, which is the praiſe of his gifts: but he hath given his gifts to another

               <p>True indeed: for the fineſt cloth is ſooneſt ſtained. And as worms ingender ſooner in ſoft &amp; tender wood, then in that which is more hard and knotty; and as moths do breed ſooner in fine wooll then in courſe flocks: even ſo pride and vain glory do ſooner aſſault an excellent and rare man in all kind of knowledge and vertue, then another of meaner gifts: and therefore pride is ſaid to ſpring out of the aſhes of all vertues. For men will be proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are wiſe, learned, godly, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, humble, &amp;c. Pride therefore may very fitly bee compared to the crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock ſpines, which grow out of the root of the very beſt Apple-tree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay the truth, this is one of the laſt engines and weapons which the Divell uſeth for the overthrowing of Gods own children, even to blow them up with pride, as it were with gun-powder. For, as we ſee it come to paſſe in the ſiege of ſtrong holds, when no battery or force of ſhot will prevaile, the laſt remedy and policy is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and blow it up with traines
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:175199:31"/> of gun-powder; ſo when Sathan can no way prevail againſt ſome excellent ſervants of God, his laſt device is to blow them up with pride, as it were with gun-powder.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:175199:33"/> For to be proud of apparell, is as if a thiefe ſhould be proud of his halter, a beggar of his clouts, a child of his gay, or a fool of his bable.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they doe ſo exceedingly ſwell with pride, that it is to bee feared they will burſt with it as they walk in the ſtreets. And truly we may think, the very ſtones in the ſtreet, and the beams in the houſes doe quake and wonder at their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, intolerable and exceſſive pride.

Can you ſay, when mens and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens apparell is ſober, modeſt, and Chriſtian like, that they have proud hearts, and are proud of that attire? You goe very farr indeed, to judge the heart. You ought to judge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of ſuch as goe ſoverly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:175199:37"/> attired, even that their heart is according to their attire. And for you, wee may rather think your heart is vain, light, and fooliſh, becauſe your attire doth ſtrongly argue it: And, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The triall of your countenance teſtifieth againſt you: you declare your ſinnes as Sodom, and hide them not, <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.9.</hi>

               <p>I may well ſet down what I will: but ſurely moſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will doe what they liſt. For veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be thought, that many of this age have forſworne God and his word, and all goodneſſe. For they are come to this point, let God ſay what he will, they will doe what they liſt. For as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>They have made a covenant with hell, and with death, and are grown to an agreement, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.15.</hi> And I doe verily think, if God himſelfe ſhould come downe from heaven in his own perſon, and diſſwade men and women from this vanity of apparell, yet would they ſtill uſe it, as it were in deſpight of God, and as it were to anger him the more. For they are ſo extraordinarily enamoured, and ſo immoderately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with it, and doe ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and altogether dote on it, and are ſo wood-mad of it, that they will have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:175199:37"/> it, though men and Angels, and all the world ſay nay: nay, which is more, though they ſhould goe to the Divell quicke with it. And therefore it is but loſt labour to ſpeake againſt it, preach againſt it, or write againſt it. It is but even to plough the ſea, or knock at a deafe mans door; for there is no hope of any reformation. Onely this we gaine, that the world is reproved and convicted of ſin. And theſe things ſhall ſtand in a record a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, in the laſt day: ſo that they may ſay, they had a fair warning, and that there was a Prophet among them.</p>

                  <hi>Yet for all this, I pray you ſet us down ſome directions and rules, out of Gods holy Book, concerning attire. For albeit ſome be very bad, and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in theſe things, yet there be ſome others which are well diſpoſed, and will (no doubt) make ſome conſcience to frame themſelves according to the rules of Gods word.</hi>

               <p>Well then, for their ſakes which are well diſpoſed, I will ſet downe ſome few directions. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>1 Tim. 2.9.</hi> willeth, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould array themſelves in come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparell, with ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſty, as becometh women that profeſſe the feare of God: and not with broydered haire, or gold, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:175199:38"/> pearls, or caſtly apparell. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> giveth like rules alſo:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3.</note> for he ſaith, ſpeaking of Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and profeſſours of holy religion, That <hi>their apparell muſt not bee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that is, not conſiſt ſo much in outward bravery; as <hi>broidered hair, gold put about, &amp;c. as it muſt be inward, that the hid man of the heart may be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is a thing before God much ſet by. For after this manner,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>in times paſt the holy women which truſted in God did attire themſelves;</hi> as <hi>Sarah, Rebeica, Rachel,</hi> and ſuch like ancient and grave matrons.</p>

               <p>In four things, which are ſet down in the fore-named places, to wit, ſhamefacedneſſe, modeſty, a quiet ſpirit, and a meek ſpirit.</p>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe be ſine ſuits of apparell indeed: I would all women would put them on, and never put them off, but wear them continually: for they are the better for wearing, though all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell be the worſe.</hi>

               <p>If women would deck them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inwardly with theſe aforeſaid vertues, they would be unto them as ornaments of gold, and jewels of pearl. <hi>For the woman that feareth the Lord ſhall be praiſed.</hi>

               <p>This is all that I can ſay touching that point, That it muſt be as the Apoſtle ſaith, comely, decent, handſome, neat and ſeemly: not light, not wanton, not laſcivious, not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, not offenſive.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But who ſhall judge what is comely, ſober, handſome, modeſt? &amp;c. For every man and woman will ſay, their apparell is decent and cleanly, how gallant, brave, and flanting ſoever they be.</hi>

               <p>Herein the examples of the moſt godly, wiſe, grave, and modeſt men and women are to be followed: for who can better judge what is comely, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and modeſt, then they?</p>

               <p>The more is the pity. But alas, wee ſee the ſway of the time, and rage of the ſtream is ſo violent, that it carrieth before it whatſoever is not ſetled, and very deep rooted. And ſome godly and well diſpoſed perſons, whoſe hearts are not with theſe things, but with God, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perforce carried away with the violence of the winde and tide;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:175199:39"/> whoſe caſe, though it cannot well bee defended or excuſed, yet it is much to be pitied and lamented.</p>

               <p>There is one thing yet more to be added: to wit, that attire be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mens places, callings and degrees.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175199:39"/> mean Gentlewemen, yea ſome Gentlewomen of their owne making, will ruifle it, and brave it out in their attire like Counteſſes and Ladies of honour.

So that now the old proverb is verified: <hi>Every Jack will be a Gentleman, and Joan is as good as my Lady.</hi> For now we cannot, by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, diſcerne the maid from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, nor the waiting Gentle-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from her Lady.

The Adulterer, with his one ſinne of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, maketh all theſe deadly wounds in himſelfe: and it is an hundred to one hee will never get them cured, but will die, and bleed to death of them. Lo, thus you ſee the dangerous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition of this ſin. Shall wee now therefore make light of it? Shall wee ſay, It is but a trick of youth? Shall wee ſmooth over the matter with ſweet words, when the holy Ghoſt maketh it ſo hainous and capitall? Shall wee make nothing of that which draweth downe Gods wrath upon the ſoule, body, goods, name, wife and children? That were an intolerable blindneſſe, and moſt extreme hardneſſe of heart.

               <p>Then will I briefly diſpatch things in order. And firſt of all, I reaſon from the words of the Apoſtle before alledged, That if covetouſneſſe, and the love of money be the root of all evil, then it is the root of idolatrie, the root of murther, the roote of theft, the root of lying, the root of ſwearing, the roote of ſymony, the roote of bribery, the roote of uſurie, the roote of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the roote of all contentions in the Church, and the roote of all brabbling and brawling in the Common-wealth. Moreover, it ſpreadeth farre and neare, it dwelleth in every houſe, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very towne, in every <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttie: it pryeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every corner, it creepeth into every heart: it annoyeth our Phyſicians, it infecteth our Divines, it choaketh our Lawyers, it woundeth our Far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mers, it baneth our Gentlemen, it murthereth our Tradeſmen, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcheth our Merchants, it ſtingeth our Mariners. O covetouſnes, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe! It is the poyſon of all things, the wound of Chriſtianity, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:175199:51"/> bane of all goodneſſe. For covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe marres all: it marreth all every where, in all places, in all degrees, among all perſons. It marreth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages: for it coupleth young to old, and old to young. It marreth hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, it marreth all good houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it marreth almeſ-deeds, it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Religion, it marreth Profeſſors, it marreth Miniſters, it marreth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, it marreth all things. And therefore, what ſin ſo grievous, what evill ſo odious, what vice ſo enormous as this? For this cauſe it was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſaid of one, That all other vices are but factors to covetouſneſſe, &amp; ſerve for Porters to fetch and bring in her living. Shee maketh ſymony her drudge, bribery her drudge, uſurie her drudge, deceite her drudge, ſwearing her drudge, lying her drudge. O what a Divell incarnate is this, that ſetteth ſo many vices a work, &amp; hath ſo many factors and underlings to ſerve her turne! Are they not in a pretty caſe, thinke you, that are infected with this ſinne? Oh they are in a moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe. It had beene good they had never beene borne. For being alive, they are dead: dead, I meane, in their ſoules. For covetouſnes is ſoules poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſoules bane. Covetouſneſſe is the ſtrongeſt poyſon to the ſoul that is. It is a confection of all the Spiders,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:175199:52"/> Toads, Snakes, Adders, Scorpions, Baſilisks, and all other the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous vermine of the whole world.

                  <hi>Indeed it muſt needs bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that covetouſneſſe is a very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne: yea, even a Monſter with ſeven heads. Yet for all that, wee ſee in this our iron age, how many of all ſorts are infected with it, and how few will give any thing to any holy uſe. Moſt men now adayes have nothing to ſpare for Chriſt, nothing for his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nothing for his Church, nothing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:175199:52"/> for the poor children of God, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy members of Chriſt. Chriſt is little beholden unto them: for they will doe nothing for him, no not ſo much as ſpeake a good word in his cauſe, or the cauſe of his poore ſaints. Every little thing with them is too much for God and good men. For when they come to giving unto holy and neceſſary uſes, then they will ſtick at a peny, and grudge at a groat, and every thing is too much: But to beſtow upon themſelves, nothing is too much. Nothing is too much for luſt, for pleaſure, for back, belly, and building, for cards and dice, for whores and harlots, for rioting and revelling, for tavernes and brothel-houſes. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands are little enough, and too little for their expences this way. It is lamentable to conſider, what maſſes of money are ſpent and beſtowed upon theſe things. But alas, alas, how heavie an account are they to make in the day of the Lord, which ſo ſpend their lands, livings, and revenues! I quake to think what ſhall become of them at laſt. It were well for them, if they might be in no worſe caſe then a Crocodile, or a Cur-dog.</hi>

For what is become of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narthes, Kings, Princes, Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and Magnificoes, that ever the World had? Where is <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Alexander, Caeſar, Pompey,

Though they were as gods, yet have they dyed as men, and are fallen like others.</p>
               <p>Who now careth for them? who talketh of them? who feareth them? who regardeth them? do not beggers tread upon them? Yet while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they were the lords of the world; they were as terrible as lions, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to all men, full of pomp and glory, dignity, and majeſty.

Put caſe one of theſe great rich worldlings ſhould bee cloathed in velvet and cloth of gold in moſt ſtately manner, and alſo ſhould bee ſet at his table, furniſhed with all the dainties of the world, ſhould bee attended and waited upon by many in moſt lordly and po<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Even ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pomp and pleaſures wicked worldlings have here below, yet their guilty and helliſh conſcience is as it were a dagger held alwayes hard to their heart, ſo as they can have no found comfort in any thing. Or let mee give it you thus: Put caſe a man hath committed high treaſon, and were therefore apprehended, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:175199:62"/> and condemned to be hanged, drawne, and quartered; what then can comfort a man in this caſe? can mirth, can muſick, can gold, can ſilver, can lands, can livings? No, no, none of all theſe can help him, or give him any comfort: For the continuall thoughts of death doe ſo gripe him at the heart, that none of all theſe can doe him any good, or any whit mitigate his griefe. What then is the thing that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him in this caſe? Only a pardon ſealed with the Kings broad ſeale, and ſubſcribed with his owne hand. For aſſoone as hee hath got this, his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie heart reviveth, and lea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This then aſſuredly is the very caſe of all profane Atheiſts and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who are not aſſured of the King of heaven his pardon for their ſinne: and then, what joy can they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their meat, drink, goods, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, wives, children, lands, revenues, or any thing whatſoever? For the dreadfull thoughts of hell doe eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones croſſe them inwardly, and quite damp and daſh all their mirth.

For ſure it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175199:63"/> is, that inwardly they have many a cold pull, and many heart-gripes. And all their mirth and jollity is but a giggling from the teeth outward: they can have no ſound comfor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The gripple muck-rabers had as leeve part with their bloud as their goods. They will pinch their owne backs and bellies, to get their god into their cheſts.

Secondly, if God leave them ſometimes to be overcome of the world, yet hee, in his great wiſedome and mercy, turneth it to their good. For thereby hee firſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth them, and afterwards raiſeth them up againe.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> And ſo all things work together for good to them that love God. Thirdly, I anſwer, wee muſt live by rules, and not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. For even the beſt of Gods people have had their wants and weakneſſes. Therefore wee may not frame rules to live by out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmi ies of the moſt excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God. Wicked therefore and impious is their allegation, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, <hi>Lots</hi> drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Peters</hi> fall, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſlips, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> weakneſſe, &amp;c. for a ſhelter and defence of themſelves in the like ſins. Laſtly, I anſwer, that you greatly wound your ſelf in your own ſpeech: ſo far off are you from mending your market any whit thereby. For if
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:175199:65"/> Preachers and other godly men (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many prayers, teares, and much meanes uſed, cannot eſcape ſcot-free, but ſometimes are wounded, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overthrowne by the world and the Divell; what then ſhall become of you, which uſe no meanes at all, nor any gain-ſtriving, but willingly give place to the Divell? If the Divell did over-maſter <hi>David, Lot, Samſon, Solomon,</hi> and other ſuch excellent worthies; alas, what ſhall become of meer worldlings and Atheiſts?

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:175199:66"/> a Hare to her old fourm, and hee old covert. For this is the very covert and thicket of the world, wherein they would hide covetouſneſſe: but I will doe what I can to hunt you out of it by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 11.14.</note>Firſt, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more then is right, ſhall ſurely come to poverty.</hi> So then you ſee, that covetouſneſſe bringeth poverty. Thus therefore I reaſon: That which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth poverty is no good husbandry: but covetouſneſſe and too much ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bringeth poverty; therefore it is no good husbandry. The ſame <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that is given to gaine, troubleth his owne houſe.</hi> That is, the covetous man is an occaſion of many evils in his eſtate and family. From Scripture I doe thus reaſon: That which troubleth a mans houſe is no good husbandry: but covetouſneſſe troubleth a mans houſe; therefore it is no good husbandry. Laſt of all, the old Proverb ſaith. <hi>Covetouſneſſe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth nothing home:</hi> And therefore it is no good husbandry. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wee ſee, that men for covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of more, loſe that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might have had. One of the wiſe Heathen ſaith,<note place="margin">Heſiodus.</note> 
                  <hi>Evill gaine is as bad as loſſe.</hi> But the covetous man doth ſeek after wicked gaine, and therefore ſeeketh loſſe; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:175199:66"/> is no good husband. Another ſaith,<note place="margin">Phocilides.</note> 
                  <hi>Unjuſt gain bringeth forth loſſe and miſery.</hi> And therefore it is far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough off from vertue and all good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. Thus then, I hope, you are ſo hunted both by God and men, that this covert cannot hide you. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt out of it, and ſeek ſome other ſhelter: for this will not ſerve your turn.</p>

Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, that God provided for man before man was: then how much more will hee provide for man now that hee is? Is hee our Father, and will hee not provide for us? Is he our King, and will he not regard us? Is hee our ſhepherd, and will hee not look to us? Hath hee provided heaven for us, and will hee not give us earth? Hath hee given us his Sonne Chriſt, and ſhall hee not with him give us all things?

                  <hi>Sith the care and providence of God is ſo great for his children, as you have largely declared: what then, I pray you, is the cauſe why God ſuffereth his to bee brought into ſo many troubles and neceſſities?</hi>

               <p>Their profit and benefit is the cauſe, and not their hurt. For he loveth them, when hee ſmiteth them. Hee favoureth them, when he ſeemeth to be moſt againſt them. Hee aimeth at their good, when hee ſeemeth to bee moſt angry with them. He woundeth them, that hee may heale them. Hee preſſeth them, that hee may eaſe them. Hee maketh them cry, that afterward they may laugh. Hee alwaies meaneth well unto them, hee never meaneth hurt. Hee is moſt conſtant in his love towards them. If he bring them into neceſſities, it is but for the triall of their faith, love, patience, and diligence in prayer.</p>
               <p>If he caſt them into the fire, it is not to conſume them; but to purge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them. If he bring them into great dangers, it is but to make them call upon him more earneſtly for help and deliverance.</p>
               <p>He preſſeth us, that wee might cry: wee cry, that wee may be heard: wee are heard, that we might be delivered. So that here is no hurt done: we are worſe ſcared than hurt.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:175199:75"/>
               <p>Even as a mother, when her childe is way-ward, threateneth to throw it to the Wolfe, or ſcareth it with ſome poker, or bul-begger, to make it cling more unto her, and be quiet: So the Lord oftentimes ſheweth us the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible faces of troubles and dangers, to make us cleave and cling faſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and alſo to teach us to eſteeme better of his gifts when wee enjoy them, and to bee more thankfull for them; as health, wealth, peace, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſafety, &amp;c. So then ſtill we ſee, here is nothing meant on Gods part but good: as it is written,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>All things worke together for good to them that love God.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Heb. 12 10. Heb. 12.14.</note> even the afflictions of Gods children are ſo ſanctified unto them by the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.6.</note> that thereby they are made partakers of the holineſſe of God.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.14. Phil 3.10.</note> Thereby they enjoy the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe. Thereby they attaine unto a greater meaſure of joy in the holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.32</note> Thereby the world is crucified to them, and they to the world.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 4.</note> Thereby they are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the death of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are kept from the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world. Thereby they learne experience, patience, hope, &amp;c. So that all things conſidered, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are no loſers by their afflictions, but gainers. It is better for them to have them, than to be without them:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:175199:76"/> they are very good for them. For when Gods children are chaſtiſed, it is as it ſhould be. For to them the croſſe is mercy, and loſſe is gain. Afflictions are their ſchooling, and their adverſitie their beſt Vniverſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is good for mee</hi> (ſaith the holy man of God) <hi>that I have been afflicted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> 
                  <hi>that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> By his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions therefore hee learned much, and became a good ſchollar in Gods booke, and well ſeen in his ſtatutes and lawes. Hee grew to great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and judgement by his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All things turned about in Gods mercifull providence, to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting comfort. For I ſay againe and againe, That all things tend to the good of Gods choſen people. And therefore that eſtate which God will have his children to be in, is alwayes beſt for them: becauſe he who can beſt diſcern what is beſt, ſeeth it to bee beſt for them: whether it bee ſickneſſe or health, poverty or plenty, priſon or liberty, proſperity or adverſity. For ſometimes ſickneſſe is better for us then health, and poverty then plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Are therefore the children of God ſick? It is beſt for them. Are they poore? It is beſt for them. Are they in any trouble? It is beſt for them: becauſe their good Father will turne it to the beſt. Hee will oftentimes cut
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:175199:76"/> us ſhort of our luſts and deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſeeth we will bane our ſelves with them. Hee in fatherly care will take the knife from us, becauſe hee ſeeth wee will hurt our ſelves with it. Hee will keep us ſhort of health and wealth, becauſe hee knoweth wee will bee the worſe for them. Hee will not give us too much eaſe and proſperity in this world: for hee knoweth it will poyſon us. Hee will not allow us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſt, like ſtanding ponds: for then hee knoweth wee will gather ſcum and filth. Hee dealeth fatherly and mercifully with us in all things; even then ſeeking our greateſt good, when wee thinke hee doth us moſt harme.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak all in a word: he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us into troubles and ſtraits to this end eſpecially, that hee may hear of us. For he right wel knoweth our nature, he is well acquainted with our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; hee knoweth we will not come at him, but when wee ſtand in need of him: we care not for him, ſo long as all goeth well with us. But if wee come into diſtreſſe, or want any thing that we faine would have, then hee is ſure to heare of us: as he ſaith by the Prophet;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 3.15.</note> 
                  <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
               </p>

Therefore God hath commanded his Angels to guard them, being ſuch young Princes as they are: yea, hee hath given a very ſtrait charge to all his creatures to looke to them, to ſee to them, that they want nothing, that they take no hurt: ſo jealous, ſo chary, ſo tender is he of them.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.2.

               <p>You have uttered a great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:175199:80"/> and a moſt certain truth. For there is no affection or triall, which God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth upon his children, but if they endure it quietly, truſt in his mercy firmly, and tarry his good pleaſure obediently, it hath a bleſſed and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable end. Therefore the people of God may well be merry in the midſt of their ſorrowes. They may with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and comfort ſubmit themſelves to their Fathers corrections, taking them patiently, and even kiſſing his holy rod, and ſaying in themſelves, Sith my Father will have it ſo, I am content; ſeeing it is his mind, I am willing withall. As old <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi>

               <p>This ſinne is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the former. It is a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Table. It toucheth the perſon of God himſelfe. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Goſpel, it is to contemne God himſelfe, whoſe Goſpel it is.

Therefore it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:175199:81"/> meddling with this ſinne. It is to meddle with edged tooles, to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Princes matters, to touch the Ark, to come neer the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which all were things full of great perill and danger. Yea, it is to ſpill the Sacrament. It is <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> It is to raile at a King. It is to ſpet God in the face. It is high treaſon againſt the King of glory. Therefore this ſinne, of all other, can never be endured, and may at no hand be borne withall. For can a mortall King endure the contempt of his lawes? Can he put up the contempt of his own perſon? Can hee abide any to ſpet at his Scepter, or to throw a ſtone at it? No ſurely, hee will not. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Hee that deſpiſeth Moſes lawes, dieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, under two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

                  <hi>You have ſpoken moſt truly, and alſo ſhewed it out of the Scriptures, that the contempt of the Goſpel is a moſt hainous ſinne: yet for all that, it is moſt lamentable to conſider, how little men eſteeme it, and how light they make of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:175199:82"/> it. Many regard it no more then an egge-ſhell, they thinke it not worth a galley halfe-penny: they will not goe to the doore to heare it; they take it to bee a breath from us, and a ſound to them, and ſo the matter is ended. They eſteeme it but as a noiſe, or empty ſound in the aire; or as a voice a farre off, which a man underſtandeth not: they never felt the power of it in their hearts. Therefore they preferre their ſheep, their farmes, their oxen, their profits, their pleaſures, yea every thing before it; they know it not to bee any ſuch precious jewell, as it is. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord Jeſus himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to a hid treaſure, and a moſt precious pearle, yet theſe filthy ſwine of the world tread it under feet: for they know not the price of it.

                  <hi>ſaith, All the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of gold and ſilver, pearle and precious ſtones, are not to bee compared to it: yet theſe beaſts, theſe dogs and hogs of the world, contemne it: They eſteeme a cow more then Chriſts moſt glorious Goſpel. They are like Eſops cocke, which made more account of a barley corne, then all the precious ſtones in the world: they are like little children, that eſteeme their rattle more then a bagge of gold; they are like the Gadarens, which eſteemed their hogs more then Chriſt and his Goſpel: they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:175199:82"/> make nothing of it: they thinke it not worth the while. Many of them ſit idle in the ſtreets, even upon the Sabbaths: while the Goſpel is preached in their Churches, many are at cards and tables in the Ale-houſes. Many on the Sabbath ſleep upon their beds all the Sermon while in the afternoon. Many will heare a Sermon in the forenoon, and they take that to be as much as God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at their hands, and that hee is ſomewhat beholden to them for it; but as for the afternoon, they will heare none: then they will to bowls or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Theſe men ſerve God in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and the devill in the afternoon. Some runne after whores and harlots on the Sabbath, ſome runne to dancing and bear-baitings, ſome ſit upon their ſtalls, ſome ſit in their ſhops, ſome by the fire ſide, ſome ſit idle in the ſtreets, ſome goe to the ſtole-ball, and others look on.

                  <hi>This people will ſit before thee, and heare thy words: but they will not do them. For with their mouthes they make jeſts: and their heart goes after covetouſneſſe.

               <p>You have ſpoken a truth, And wee have heard before how the old world was plagued for it. And wee read how grievouſly the Iewes were afflicted by the Romans for this ſinne: as our Lord Ieſus did plainly foretell. We read alſo, that after the Lord had preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel himſelfe, and ſpread it abroad by his Apoſtles, conquering the world thereby (which things was ſignified by the white horſe,<note place="margin">Re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:175199:86"/> plague the earth with warres, bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheddings, tumults, dearth, famine, and peſtilence: which are all ſignified by the red horſe, the black horſe, and the pale horſe, which did appeare at the opening of the ſecond, third, and fourth ſeale. So likewiſe undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God will ſeverely puniſh all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, wrongs, and contempts done to his faithfull Embaſſadors; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>Revel. 11.5.</hi> where it is ſet downe, That, <hi>If any would hurt the two witneſſes with their two olives, and two candleſticks,</hi> (whereby is ſignified the faithfull Preachers of the Goſpel, with all their ſpirituall treaſures and heavenly light) <hi>fire ſhould proceed out of their mouthes, and devoure their adverſaries;</hi> that is, The fire of Gods wrath ſhould conſume all that had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, either by mocks, flouts, railing, ſlanders, impriſonment, or any other kinde of indignity. Of this wee have a plaine example or two in the Scripture. Firſt, we read how fire came downe from heaven, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the contemptuous Captaine and his fifty,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 1.10.</note> at the threatning and calling for of <hi>Eliah.</hi> Secondly, how two Beares came out of the Forreſt,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 2.23.</note> and tare in pieces two and forty yonkers which mocked <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the Prophet of God, calling him bald-head, bald-head. So then by theſe examples it is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:175199:87"/> manifeſt, that howſoever the Lord may winke at theſe things for a time, and make as though hee ſaw them not, yet the time will come, when hee will raine fire and brimſtone upon all the ſcoffers of his faithfull miniſters, and contemners of his Goſpel. All this is plainly declared in the firſt chapter of the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon:</hi> where is ſhewed how the wiſedome of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Ieſus Chriſt the higheſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doth cry aloud all abroad in the world, and manifeſt himſelfe in the open ſtreets; but yet is contemned of wicked worldlings, and ſcoffing fools.

Then ſhall they call upon mee, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not find me</hi> Here then wee ſee his terrible wrath and vengeance, threatned from heaven, againſt all profane contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Chriſt and his everlaſting Goſpel, or any of the faithful <gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">

               <p>True indeed. But yet wee ſee by lamentable experience, how men are given over both to ſweare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare. For at this day there is: no ſinne more common amongſt us than ſwearing: for many there bee which cannot ſpeak ten words, but one ſhall bee an oath. And numbers have got ſuch a wicked cuſtome of ſwearing, that they can by no meanes leave it, no more than a Black-moore can change his skinne, or a Leopard his ſpots: For it is, made naturall unto them through cuſtome, and they have got the habit of it. I do verily think, if it were high treaſon to ſweare, yet ſome could not leave ſwearing. And ſure I am (as light as we make of it) that it is high treaſon againſt the

               <p>O what a lamentable thing is it; wee may well take up the old complaint of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:175199:91"/> ſaith,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.20.</note> that in his time <hi>The land did mourne, becauſe of oathes.</hi> And wee may well wonder, that the Land ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not becauſe of oaths. For if God were not a God of infinite patience, how could he endure his moſt ſacred and glorious Name to bee ſo many thouſand times blaſphemed in one day, &amp; that by ſuch miſerable wretches as we be!</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Wee may indeed admire and wonder at the patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, that he ſpareth us ſo long, &amp; giveth us ſo large a time of repentance. But ſure it is, that the Prophet ſaith, That howſoever the Lord is ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet hee is great in power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nah. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and will not ſurely cleare the wicked. Though he may winke at their monſtrous oathes for a time; yet hee forgetteth them never a whit, but ſcoreth them up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtreth them in his book of accounts: ſo as they ſtand in record againſt them. And when the great day of reckoning ſhall come, hee will fet them all in order before them, and lay them to their charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let not the wicked ſwearers and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers therefore thinke that they ſhall alwaies ſcape ſcot-free, becauſe God letteth them alone a while, and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their puniſhment. For the longer God deferreth, the more terrible will his ſtrokes bee when they come. The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:175199:92"/> longer an arrow is held in the bow, the ſtronger will be the ſhot when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth. Though God have leaden feet, and cometh ſlowly to execute wrath, yet hath hee an iron hand, and will ſtrike deadly when hee cometh. Though God giveth the wicked ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for a time (ſaith Job) yet his eyes are fixed upon all their waies.</hi>

For whatſoever a man ſweareth by, hee calleth it as a witneſſe unto his conſcience, that he ſpeaketh the truth, and lyeth not: which thing onely belongeth unto God. And therefore in ſwearing by creatures, we do robbe God of his honour. Therefore to ſweare by the croſſe of the money, or by bread, or by mouſe foote, or the fire, which they call Gods Angel, or any ſuch like, is a robbing of God of his honour, and an aſcribing of that to the creature, which is proper only to the Creator.</p>

But this is to be noted, that God doth not immediatly puniſh all notorious ſinners in this life, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth thouſands to the judgment of the great day. In this life he only cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out ſome few, whom he ſmiteth for the example of others, that they might feare and tremble, and learne by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:175199:100"/> mens harmes to beware.</p>
               <p>Therefore, even in this life, wee ſee before our eyes, ſome lyers, ſome drunkards, ſome whore-mongers, ſome ſwearers, ſome miſers of the world, ſome ruffians and cut-throats, ſtricken downe by the revenging hand of God: But whereas God ſmiteth one of theſe in this life, hee letteth an hundred eſcape. For if hee ſhould puniſh all offenders in this life, to what purpoſe ſhould the judgement to come ſerve? If hee ſhould puniſh none, then we ſhould think there were no God, or that hee were ſhut up idle in heaven, and would do neither good nor evill, nor once meddle in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the earth; as ſome Epicures have dreamed. Therefore to avoid both theſe extremities, God in his heavenly wiſedome hath thought good to meete with ſome, even in this world.</p>

Wherefore in ſtead of meat, hee ſhall feed on gravell: and in ſtead of wheat, on pebble ſtones. Small pleaſure is takes in the end in goods ill gotten, or livings unlawfully come by.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:175199:104"/> whom is babbling? to whom are wounds without cauſe? to whom is the redneſſe of the eies? Even to them that tarry long at the wine: to them that goe and ſeeke out mixt wine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 23.21.</note> In the ſame chapter he ſaith, <hi>Bee not of the number of them which are bibbers of wine, or of them which glut themſelves with fleſh: for the drinker and the feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall become poore: and the flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhall be cloathed with rags.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ſaith,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Their eyes ſhall behold ſtrange women; and that they ſhall bee like him that lyeth in the midſt of the Sea, and ſleepeth in the top of the maſt.</hi> In all theſe ſpeeches the holy Ghoſt doth, in moſt lively manner, deſcribe unto us the properties of drunkards; even their ſtaggering, their reeling, their ſnorting, their ſenſleſſe ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>Concerning idleneſſe, this I ſay briefly: that it is the mother of all vice, and the ſtepdame of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: yea, it is the very bel-dame of all enormities. It is the mother of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:175199:107"/> whoredome, the mother of pride, the mother of theft, the mother of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, the mother of ignorance, the mother of error, the mother of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the mother of flandering and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, pratling and goſſiping, braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſcolding, quarrelling: and what not?

               </p>

               <p>Moreover, it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Pro. 26.14.</note> that <hi>the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard turnes himſelfe upon his bed, as the doore doth upon the hinges.</hi> That is, he keepeth his bed, as if he were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Spirit will abound in this point, it is further written of the ſloathfull man, that he ſaith, <hi>An huge Lyon is in the way:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 26.13.</note>

So then wee ſee how lively and plentifully the holy Scriptures do paint out the lazie lubbers of this world, and ſonnes of idleneſſe: which are as hardly drawne to any good thing as a Beare to the ſtake.

Againe, there be many lazy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, and luskiſh youths, both in townes and villages, which doe nothing all the day long but walke in the ſtreetes, ſit upon the ſtalles, and frequent Taverns and Ale-houſes. Many rich citizens, eſpecially women, do ordinarily lye in bed till nine of the clock, and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth riſe, and make themſelves ready to goe to dinner.

               <p>God doth allow none to live idlely: but all, great and ſmall, are to be employed one way or other: either for the benefit of the Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; or for the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their owne houſholds; or for the good of townes and pariſhes, and thoſe amongſt whom they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; or for the ſuccour and reliefe of the poore; or for the furtherance of the Goſpel, and the maintenance of the miniſtery; or for one good uſe or other. To theſe ends, our wits, our learning, our reading, our skill, our policie, our wealth, our health, our wiſedome, and authority, are to be referred: knowing this, that one day wee ſhall come to give an account of our Bailywick, and to be reckoned withall for the employments of our Talents.<note place="margin">Job 5.7.</note> For this cauſe <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Man is borne to travell, as the ſparkes flie upward.</hi> And God hath laid this upon <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes thou ſhalt eat thy bread.</hi> Some do ſet downe foure cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why every man ſhould labour dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in his calling.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to beare the yoke laid upon all mankind by the Lord.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:175199:109"/>
               <p>Secondly, to get the neceſſaries of this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to live to the profit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to avoid evill thoughts and actions.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> findeth great fault with ſome in the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> becauſe they walked inordinately, that is, idlely, and out of a lawfull calling; and therefore concluded, That ſuch as would not labour, ſhould not eat. So then, wee do plainly ſee, that God alloweth idleneſſe in none. For, when we are idle (as hath been ſhewed before) wee lie open to the Divell and his temptations, and he gets within us, and prevaileth againſt us. While <hi>David</hi> tarried idlely at home in the beginning of the yeare, when Kings uſed to go forth to the battell, hee was ſoone overtaken with thoſe two ſoule ſinnes of adultery and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter. So long as <hi>Samſon</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Philiſtines, hee could never be taken or overcome: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee gave himſelfe to idleneſſe and pleaſure, he not onely committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Strumpet <hi>Dalilah,</hi> but alſo was taken of his enemies, and his eyes miſerably pulled out. Theſe examples doe ſhew what a dangerous ſinne wickeſſe is. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſends us to ſchools to the little
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:175199:110"/> Creature, the Ant, to learne of her both to avoid idleneſſe, and alſo to uſe wiſedome and providence in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">Prov. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Go to the Piſmire, O ſluggard, behold her waies, and be wiſe: For ſhee, having no guide, task-maſter, nor ruler, prepareth her meat in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and gathereth her food in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi> And in good ſooth it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to obſerve, what infinite paines, and unwearied labour, this ſilly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taketh in Summer, that ſhe may be well provided for againſt Winter. Let us therefore learne wiſedome from her example: and let us ſet before our eyes the looking-glaſſe of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let us conſider how the birds flye, the fiſhes ſwimme, the wormes creep, the heavens turne, the elements move, the ſea ebbeth and floweth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly: yea the earth it ſelfe, which is the moſt heavie and unweildy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all other, yet never ceaſeth his working, bringeth forth his burden in Summer, and labouring inwardly all the Winter, in concocting, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting his nouriſhment for the next ſpring. Thus wee ſee how all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are diligently and painfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in their kinds. And therefore it is a great ſhame for us to live idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careleſly, and diſſolutely. Let us therefore learne once (at laſt) to flie ſloath, and every one to live faithfully,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:175199:110"/> diligently, and induſtriouſly in our ſeverall callings. So ſhall we both keep Satan at the ſtaves end, and alſo much ſinne out of our ſoules, which otherwiſe idleneſſe will force in upon us.</p>

                  <hi>I muſt needs confeſſe that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a groſſe vice, in whomſoever it is found. But ſpecially, in my judgement, it is moſt odious in Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi>

               <p>That is ſo in truth. For they ought to be the guides, governours, ſhepherds, and watch-men over the people of God. And therefore for them to neglect their duties and charges, is a moſt horrible thing, ſith it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hurt of many. Therefore well ſaid the Heathen Poet,<note place="margin">Hom. l. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>A Magiſtrate or Miniſter may not be lazie or ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to whom the nurſing of the people is given in charge, and of whom many things are to be cared for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a lamentable thing therefore is it, when Magiſtrates are profane, irreligious, popiſh, vicious, and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the duties of their calling? And how much more lamentable is it, when Miniſters neglect their ſtudies, ſlacke preaching and prayer, and give up themſelves, ſome to covetouſneſſe, ſome to pride, ſome to husbandry, ſome to other worldly affaires, and ſome to ſpend their time idlely in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:175199:111"/> Ale-houſes, gaming, rioting, and lewd company? Would to God therefore that both theſe kinds of publike perſons would caſt off idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſloath, and with diligence, faithfulneſſe, care and conſcience, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the duties of their places. For it is an excellent thing for any to be a good man in his place: As a good Magiſtrate that ruleth well, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth wiſely, which favoureth good men, and good cauſes, and defendeth them: which alſo ſetteth himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt bad men and bad cauſes, and puniſheth them ſharply and ſeverely: which moreover maintaineth vertue, even of a very love hee beareth unto it in his heart: and puniſheth vice, of a very zeale and hatred againſt it: and not for his credit onely, or to pleaſe ſome, or becauſe he muſt needs doe it, and can doe no leſſe, or for any ſuch ſiniſter reſpect: but even of a love to God, a care of his glory, a conſcience of duty, and a fervent zeale againſt ſin. So likewiſe, it is a notable thing for a Miniſter to be a good man in his place: to be ſtudious in the Law of God, diligent and painfull in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that out of a love of God, a zeale of his glory, deep pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward the ſoules of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeking by all meanes poſſible to win them unto God; carrying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:175199:111"/> in all his actions amongſt them wiſely, religiouſly, unblameably, and inoffenſively. So againe, it is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thing to be a good rich man, which doth much good with his riches, which keepeth a good houſe, relieveth the poore, miniſtreth to the neceſſities of the Saints, and giveth cheerfully and with diſcretion, where need is. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is a commendable thing to be a good neighbour, a good Townſman, by whom a man may live quietly, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, joyfully, and comfortably.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to be a good poore man: that is, humble, lowly, dutifull, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ready to help, and ready to pleaſe. Oh, I ſay, this is a moſt excellent and glorious thing, when every man keepeth his ſtanding, his range, and his ranke; when all men, with care and conſcience, performe the duties of their places: when the husband doth the duty of an husband; and the wife of a wife: when the father doth the duty of a father; and the childe of a childe: when the maſter doth the duty of a maſter; and the ſervant of a ſervant: when every man ſetteth God before his eyes, in doing thoſe things which eſpecially belong unto him. For herein conſiſteth the honour of God, the glory of the Prince, the crowne of the Church, the fortreſſe of the Common-wealth, the ſafety of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:175199:112"/> Cities the ſtrength of Kingdoms, and the very preſervation of all things.</p>

                  <hi>You have ſaid well in ſome things: but yet I do not ſee, but that rich men and women may live idlely, ſith they have enough wherewithall to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. For may not a man do with his owne what he liſt?</hi>

               <p>No verily. For you may not take your owne knife, and cut your owne throat with it: neither may you take your owne axe, and kill your owne childe with it. Therefore that reaſon is naught. Albeit therefore wealthy men and women have great plenty of all things, ſo as they need not labour, yet let them be profitably employed ſome way or other: let them exerciſe themſelves in one good thing or other. If they can find nothing to doe, let them give themſelves much to private prayers, and reading of the Scriptures, that they may be able to inſtruct and exhort others. Or elſe let Ladies and Gentlewomen doe as that good woman <hi>Dorcas</hi> did, that is, buy cloth, cut it out, worke it, ſew it, make ſhirts, ſmocks, coats and garments, and give them to the poore, when they haue ſo done. For it is ſaid of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> that <hi>ſhee was a woman full of good workes,</hi>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:175199:112"/> poore mans friend, ſhe clothed the poore and naked, ſhe knew it was a ſacrifice acceptable to God. Oh that the wealthy women of our Land would follow the example of <hi>Dorcas!</hi> But (alas) theſe dayes bring forth few <hi>Dorcaſes.</hi>

It ſeemes therefore, that this vice is of ſuch marvellous force, that it can bereave men of their wits, and make them ſtarke mad of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting goods by hooke or by crooke, they care not how, not from whom, ſo they have it. Yet no doubt the moſt wiſe God hath enacted many good lawes for the ſuppreſſing of this evill, and threatneth the execution of them in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and eſpecially his Law doth provide for the ſafety of the poore, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the widow and the ſtranger.

               <p>We may indeed juſtly feare and tremble. For if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, how ſhall hee ſpare us? If he ſpared not his owne people, what can we looke for?

               <p>True indeed. For it is an ordinary thing with GOD, when men will not profit by milde correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and common puniſhments, then to lay greater upon them. And when a former trouble doth us no good, we are to feare a finall conſuming trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For ſo we reade in the Prophecy of <hi>Hoſea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 3.12.</note> that at the firſt <hi>God was to Ephraim as a moth, and to Judah as rottenneſſe:</hi> but afterward, when as they profited not by it, he was to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim as a Lion, and to Judah as a Lions whelp.</hi> So the Lord ſaith in another place, that if they will not come in, and yeeld obedience at the firſt call of his wrath, then <hi>he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them ſeven times more:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 26.18.</note> but if they continue in their ſtubbornneſſe, then hee threatneth to bring <hi>ſeven times more plagues upon them,</hi>

                  <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſins.</hi> If by all theſe they would not be reformed, but walke ſtubbornly againſt him, then hee threatneth,<note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Ver. 28.</note> and the fourth time, <hi>yet ſeven times more.</hi> The proofe hereof we have in the booke of the Iudges: where wee reade how the people of Iſrael for their ſins were in ſubjection
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:175199:129"/> to the King of <hi>Aram Naharaim</hi> eight yeares: afterward,<note place="margin">Judg. 3.8.</note> becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited nothing by it, but returned to their old ſinnes; therefore they ſerved <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> eighteen yeares.<note place="margin">Judg. 3.</note> After that againe, for their new ſinnes and provocations, the Lord gave them up into the hands of <hi>Midian</hi> ſeven yeares. After all this,<note place="margin">Judg. 6.1.</note> for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſins, the Lord ſold them into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 10.7.</note> which did grievouſly vexe and oppreſſe them for the ſpace of eighteen yeares.

After all this, when they were delivered out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and returned home ſafely to their owne Nation, and enjoyed ſome good time of peace and reſt, yet at laſt they fell to the renewing of their ſins: and therefore the Lord plagued them moſt grievouſly, by the divided Greeke Empire, even <hi>Magog</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi>

                  <hi>You have very largely laid open this laſt token of vengeance: to wit, that God at the firſt doth but beat us upon the coat, but if wee continue in ſinne, he will whip us on the bare skin: and if men will not yeeld at the firſt gentle ſtrokes, then hee will ſtrike har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and harder, till hee have broken our ſtout ſtomackes, and made out great hearts come downe. Therefore it is good yeelding at the firſt: for wee ſhall get nothing by our ſturdineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

               <p>The prayers and teares of the faithfull are the ſpeciall meanes that ſtay the hand of God from ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us. For the prayers of the righteous are of great force with him: even able to doe all things. S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">James 5.11.</note> that <hi>the prayer of a righteous man availeth much, if it be fervent:</hi> and bringeth the example of <hi>Elias</hi> to prove
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:175199:130"/> it. For, ſaith he, <hi>Though Elias was a man ſubject to the like paſſions that wee be, yet was hee able by his prayers both to open and ſhut the heavens.</hi>

                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> likewiſe prevailed ſo farre with God by his prayers for <hi>Sodome,</hi> that if there had been but ten juſt men found in it, it had been ſpared.

                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Though theſe three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were amongſt them, they ſhould deliver but their owne ſoules by their righteouſneſſe.</hi> Which alſo ſheweth, that if there had been any poſſible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of him for the Land, theſe three men might have done it: but now hee was reſolutely determined to the contrary. In reſpect therefore that the zealous Preachers, and true Profeſſors of the Goſpel doe ſo much prevaile with God by their prayers, they are ſaid to be the defence and ſtrength of Kingdoms and Countries, of Churches and Common-wealths: as it is ſaid of <hi>Eliah,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 5.</note> where the Lord ſaith thus: <hi>Run to and fro by the ſtreets of Jeruſalem; behold and enquire in the open places thereof, if yee can find a man, or if there be any that executeth Judgement, and ſeeketh the truth: and I will ſpare it.</hi> Oh then marke and conſider, what a man may doe: yea, what one man may doe: what an <hi>Abraham</hi> may doe: what a <hi>Moſes</hi> may doe: what an <hi>Eliah</hi> may doe: what a <hi>Daniel,</hi> what a <hi>Samuel,</hi> what a <hi>Job,</hi> what a <hi>Noah</hi> may do!

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:175199:131"/> by their counſell, or valiant men by their ſwords. Yea, it doth evidently appeare (in the ſacred Volumne of the holy Ghoſt) that ſome one poore Preacher, being full of the Spirit and Power of <hi>Eliah,</hi> doth more in his Study (either for offence, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: either for the turning away of wrath, or the procuring of mercy) then a camp royall, even forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong: yea (as the Spirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>Though they all have their ſwords girded to their thighs,</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore the Lord minded to deſtroy them, had not Moſes (his choſen) ſtood in the breach, to turne away his wrath, leſt hee ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> See therefore what one man may doe with God. Some one man doth ſo bind the hands of God, that when he would ſtrike, he hath no power to doe it: as it is ſaid of <hi>Lot,</hi>

               <p>The beſt and ſureſt courſe that I can conſider or conceive of, is, to repent heartily for ſins paſt, and to reforme our lives in time to come, to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and to call upon him while he is neer, to forſake our owne wayes, and our owne imaginations, and to turn unto him with all our hearts, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with faſting, and with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the Prophet <hi>Joel, chap. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This is moſt plainly ſet downe in the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where the Lord ſaith thus to his people,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>If this Nation, againſt whom I have pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will repent of the plague I thought to bring upon them.</hi> Thus we doe plainly ſee what advice and counſell the Prophets and holy men of God doe give unto us. The ſumme of all is this, that if wee doe truly repent, and turne unto him with all our hearts (ſtudying to obey him, and walke in his wayes) then he will grant us any favour that wee will require at his hands. For even as a wooll-pack, or other ſoft matter, beateth backe, and dampeth the force
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:175199:137"/> of all ſhot; ſo penitent, melting, and ſoft hearts doe beat backe the ſhot of Gods wrath, and turne away his vengeance from us. Moreover, wee may obſerve, in all experience, that when Potentates are offended, or any great man hath conceived a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt ſome poore man, then he muſt runne and ride, ſend preſents, uſe his friends, breake his ſleep, and never be quiet untill hee have pacified him: Even ſo muſt wee deale with our God, ſeeing hee hath taken a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt us. O therefore that wee would ſpeedily uſe all poſſible meanes to pacifie his wrath! Oh that wee would with one heart and voice, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us (from the higheſt to the loweſt) humble our ſelves before our God, forſake our former evill wayes, be grieved for that wee have done, and purpoſe never to doe the like againe! Oh that it might goe to the hearts of us, that wee have ſo often and ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended ſo loving a God, and ſo mercifull a Father! Oh that wee would awake once at laſt, and rowſe up our drowſie hearts, and ranſacke our ſleepie conſciences, crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſinnes, that our ſins might never cry out againſt us! Oh that wee would judge our ſelves, accuſe our ſelves, indite our ſelves, and condemne our ſelves! ſo ſhould wee

Oh that all men, women, and children would feare God, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; would eſchew evill, and doe good; would ſtudy to pleaſe God in all things, and to be fruitfull in all good workes, making conſcience to perform the duties of their generall callings, and duties of their ſpeciall callings; duties of the firſt Table, and duties of the ſecond Table: that ſo God might be ſincerely worſhipped, his Name truly reverenced, his Sabbaths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly obſerved: and that every man would deale kindly, mercifully, juſtly, and uprightly with his neighbour, that there might be no complaining, no crying in our ſtreets! Oh, I ſay againe and againe, that if all of us, of what eſtate, degree, or condition ſoever, would walke in the paths of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:175199:139"/> our God, then doubtleſſe wee ſhould live and ſee good dayes, all future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhould be prevented, our peace prolonged, our ſtate eſtabliſhed, our King preſerved, and the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.

                  <hi>You have fully anſwered my queſtion, and well ſatisfied mee therein out of the Scriptures: yet, I pray you, give mee leave to adde one thing to that which you have at large ſet downe. The Lord ſaith by the Prophet Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 4.6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>that for their ſinnes and rebellions hee had given them cleanneſſe of teeth, that is, dearth and ſcarcitie: and yet they did not turne unto him. Alſo hee with-held the raine from them, and puniſhed them with drought, and yet they did not turne unto him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, hee ſmote their Corne, their great Gardens, their Orchards, Vineyards, Fig-trees and Olive-trees, with blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mildew, and the Palmer-worme did devoure them: and yet they did
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:175199:140"/> not returne unto him. Laſt of all hee ſmote them with peſtilence, and with the ſword, and overthrow them, as hee overthrew Sodome and Gomorrah, and they were as a fire-brand pluckt out of the burning: yet for all this they did not turne unto him. Yee have not turned unto mee, ſaith the Lord. But now to come to the point. Out of this I gather, that if wee multiply our tranſgreſſions, God will multiply his plagues upon us: but on the contrary, if wee would unfainedly turne unto the Lord our God with all our hearts, all plauges ſhould bee ſtayed, all dangers prevented, and no evill ſhould fall upon us. For becauſe they would not turne, therefore he ſmote them. If therefore they had turned, hee would not have ſmote them. But now, I pray you, briefly conclude this point, and declare in few words what it is that doth moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially concerne our peace and publike good.</hi>

               <p>Yes verily. For he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted, never beleeved. For whoſoever beleeveth in truth, feeleth ſometimes doubtings and waverings. Even as the ſound body feeleth many grudgings of diſeaſes, which if hee had not health hee could not feele; ſo the ſound ſoule feeleth ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which if it were not ſound it could not ſo eaſily feele. For we feele not corruption by corruption, but we foole corruption by grace. And the more grace we have, the more quicke we are in the feeling of corruption.

For when ſuch little grudgings are felt in the ſoule, the children of God oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them the certainty of Gods truth and promiſes, and ſo do eaſily overcome them. For the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple need no more to feare them then he that rides through the ſtreets upon a luſty Gelding, with his ſword by his ſide, needs to feare the barking and bawling of a few little curs and whap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</p>

And even in theſe dayes alſo ſome of Gods children at ſome times are ſhrewdly hindled this way, and brought very low, even unto deaths doore: but yet the Lord in great mercy doth recover them both from totall and finall deſpaire. Onely they are humbled and tried by theſe ſharp fits for a time, and that for their great good. For as we uſe to ſay, that an ague in a young man is a ſigne of health; ſo theſe burning fits of temptations in the elect, for the moſt part, are ſignes of Gods grace and favour.

But being juſtified by faith, we are at peace with God, and fully perſwaded of his love and favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Yes doubtleſſe. For except a man be perſwaded of the favour of God, and the forgiveneſſe of ſins, and conſequently of his ſalvation, what comfort can hee have in any thing? Beſides this, the perſwaſion of Gods love towards us is the root of all our love and cheerfull obedience towards him: For therefore wee love him and obey him, becauſe we know hee hath loved us firſt, and written our names in the Booke of life. But on the contrary, that generall doctrine of the Papiſts, which would have men alwayes doubt and feare in a ſervile
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:175199:148"/> ſort, is moſt helliſh and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For ſo long as a man ho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You are very confident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. You are perſwaded before you know. I would your ground were as good as your vaine confidence. But who is ſo bold as blind Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard? your hope is but fancy, and as a ſicke mens dreame. You hope you cannot tell what. You have no ground for what you ſay. For what hope can you have to be ſaved, when you walke in no path of ſalvation? What hope can a man have to come to <hi>London</hi> ſpeedily, that travelleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that way, but quite contrary? What hope can a man have to reap a good crop of corne, that uſeth no meanes, neither ploweth, ſoweth, nor
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:175199:149"/> harroweth? What hope can a man have to be fat and well liking of his body, that ſeldome or never eateth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meat? What hope can a man have to eſcape drowning, which leapeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea? Even ſo what hope can you have to be ſaved, when you walke nothing that way, when you uſe no meanes, when you doe all things that are contrary to the ſome? For (alas) there is nothing in you of thou things which the Scriptures doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme muſt be in all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. There be none of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſignes and tokens in you. You are ignorant, profane, and careleſſe. God is not worſhipped under your roofe. There is no true feare of God in your ſelfe, nor in your houſhold. You ſeldome heare the Word preached. You content your ſelfe with an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Miniſter. You have no prayers in your family, no reading, no ſinging of Pſalmes, no infirmitions, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, admonitions, or any other Chriſtian exerciſes. You make no conſcience of the obſervation of the Sabbath. You uſe not the name of God with any reverence. You breake out ſometimes into horrible oathes and curſings. You make an ordinary matter of ſwearing by your faith and your troth. Your wife is irreligious, your children diſſolute and ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:175199:149"/> your ſervants profane and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.

I have talked with ſome, which are both witty, ſenſible, and learned, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when they have beene
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:175199:153"/> brought to this very point and iſſue, have ſtuck ſore at it, and ſtaggered very much. And howſoever they might by wit and learning ſhuffle it over, and in a blundering ſort ſpeak reaſon, yet had they no feeling of that which they ſaid, and therefore no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: and conſequently as good never a whit, as never the better. It is the ſanctifying Spirit, that giveth feeling in this point: and therefore without the feeling of the operation of the ſame ſpirit, it can never be ſoundly anſwered. Thus then, I doe cloſe up this whole matter: As the Vine-branch cannot live and bring forth fruit, except it abide in the Vine: no more can wee, except wee abide in Chriſt, and be truly graffed in him by a lively faith: None can have any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by him, but they onely which dwell in him: None can live by Chriſt, but they which are changed into Chriſt: None are partakers of his body, but they which are in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: None can be ſaved by Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but they which are crucified with Chriſt: None can live with him being dead, but thoſe which die with him being alive. Therefore let us root downward in mortification, that wee may ſhoot upward in ſanctification: let us die to ſinne, that we may live to righteouſneſſe: let us die while wee
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:175199:153"/> are alive, that wee may live when wee are dead.</p>

But it is you, and ſuch as you are, that will take upon you to judge mens hearts. For though a mans outward actions be religious and honeſt, yet you will condemne him. And if a man give himſelfe to the Word and Praier, reforme his family, and abſtaine from the groſſe ſins of the world, you will by and by ſay, Hee is an Hypocrite.

               <p>Now you would ſhuffle up all together, as though you were as good as the beſt, and as though there were no difference of ſinners? but you muſt learne to know that there is a great difference of ſinners. For there is the penitent and the impenitent ſinner; the carefull and the careleſſe ſinner; the ſinner whoſe ſins are not imputed, and the ſinner whoſe ſins are imputed; the ſinner that ſhall be
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:175199:162"/> ſaved, and the ſinner that ſhall be damned. For it is one thing to ſin of frailty, another thing to live in it, dwell in it, and trade in it, and (as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh) to ſuck it in, as the fiſh ſucketh water,<note place="margin">Eſay 5.18.</note> and to draw it unto us with cart-ropes and cords of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore; there is as great difference betwixt a ſinner and a ſinner, as betwixt light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For though Gods children be ſinners in reſpect of the remnants of ſin within them, yet the Scriptures call them juſt and righteous, becauſe they are juſtified by Chriſt, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his grace and holy Spirit. And for this cauſe it is that S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee that is borne of God ſinneth not, 1 John 4.6.</hi>

But yet we preferre Preaching above it, becauſe Preaching is both the director and whet-ſtone of Prayer; yea, it ſteereth us aright in all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all actions and ſervices whatſoever: without the which we can keep no certaine courſe, but are ever ready to erre on this hand or that. Now whereas you ſay you find, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, but not, Preach continually, you might (if you were not wilfully
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:175199:164"/> blind) find alſo, Preach continually. For the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

But you muſt know that repentance is the rare gift of God, and it is given but to a few. For God will know him well that hee beſtoweth repentance upon, ſith it is proper onely to the Elect. It is no worldly matter. It is not attained without many and frequent prayers, and much hearing, reading, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating in the word of God. It is not ſo eaſie a matter to come by as the world judgeth. It is not found but of of them that ſeeke it diligently, and beg it earneſtly. It is no ordinary three houres matter. Cry God mercy a little for faſhion will not do it. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory ſaying of a few prayers a little before death availeth not.

                  <hi>If God have decreed mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, what can they do withall? who can reſiſt his will? why then is he angry with us? For all things muſt needs come to paſſe according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and determination.</hi>

                  <hi>O man, who art thou that pleadeſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power of the clay, to make of the ſame lumpe one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> Moreover, I anſwer, that Gods decree doth not enforce the will of man, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and moveth of it ſelfe. It hath in it ſelfe the beginning of evill m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſinneth willingly. Therefore, though the decree of God impoſeth a neceſſity upon all ſecondary cauſes (ſo
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:175199:169"/> as they muſt needs be framed and diſpoſed according to the ſame) yet no co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ction or conſtraint; for they are all carried with their voluntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Even as we ſee the plumbe of a clock, being the firſt mover, doth cauſe all the other wheeles to move, but not to move this way or that way: for in that they move, ſome one way, and ſome another, it is of themſelves; I meane, of their owne frame: ſo Gods decree doth move all ſecondary cauſes, but takes not away their owne proper motion. For God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of every action, but not of any evill in any action. As the ſoule of man is the originall cauſe of all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in man, as the Philoſophers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, but yet not of lame and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent motion, for that is from another cauſe, to wit, ſome defect in the body: ſo, I ſay, Gods decree is the root and firſt cauſe of motion, but not of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive motion, that is from our ſelves. Likewiſe, that a bell ſoundeth, the cauſe is in him that ringeth it: but that it jarreth, the cauſe is in it ſelfe. Againe, that an inſtrument ſoundeth, is in him that plaieth upon it; but that it jarreth, is in it ſelfe; that is, in its own want of tuning. So then, to ſhut up this point: all inſtruments and middle cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are ſo moved of God being the firſt Mover, that hee allwayes doth
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:175199:170"/> will holily and juſtly in his moving. But the inſtruments moved are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in contrary motions, according to their owne nature and frame: If they be good, they are carried to that which is good: but if they be evill, they are carried unto evill. So that according to the double beginning of motion and will, there is a double and divers work and effect.</p>

               <p>He and his will were made good, yet mutably good. For to be immutably good is proper onely to God. And <hi>Adam</hi> did ſo ſtand, that he might fall; as the event declared.</p>

               <p>No: but the voluntary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his will unto evill. For <hi>Adams</hi> will was neither forced nor by any violence of Gods purpoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:175199:170"/> to conſent: but he of a free will and ready mind left God, and joyned with the Divell.</p>
               <p>Thus then I doe determine, That <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned neceſſarily, if you reſpect the decree or event: but if you reſpect the firſt mover and inherent cauſe, which was his owne will, then he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned voluntarily and contingently.

               <p>Touching the decree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, there are almoſt none that make any doubt thereof: therefore ſmall proofe ſhall ſerve for this point. Onely I will conſtruct it by one or two teſtimonies out of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Firſt, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt, as hee hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that wee ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love.</hi> You ſee the words are very plaine and pregnant for this purpoſe. Another confirmation is taken out of the eight chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Thoſe whom hee knew before, did he alſo predeſtinate to be like to be like to the image of his owne Sonne, that hee might be the firſt-borne of many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>

               <p>The cauſes of election are to be found onely in God himſelfe. For his eternall election dependeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon man, neither yet upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is in man, but is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in himſelfe, and eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, in whom we are elected. This is fully proved in theſe words,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Who hath predeſtinated us to be adopted through Jeſus Chriſt in himſelfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of his glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath made us freely accepted in his beloved.</hi> Where we ſee the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth us, that his free grace, and the good pleaſure of his will, are the firſt motives or moving cauſes of our election.</p>

               <p>This is a very wicked and carnall objection, and ſheweth a vile and diſſolute mind in them that uſe it. But I would wiſh ſuch men to conſider the end of election; which is, that we ſhould lead a godly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Wee are predeſtinate to be made like the image of his Sonne,</hi> that is, <hi>to be holy and righteous.</hi> For moſt certaine it is, that wee can judge nothing of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, but by the conſequents: that is, by our calling, juſtification, and ſanctification. For when once we feele the work of grace within us, (that is, that wee are waſhed by the new birth, and renued by the holy Ghoſt, finding in our ſelves an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned hatred of ſinne, and love of righteouſneſſe) then are we ſure, and out of all doubt, that we are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to life.

                  <hi>I thinke the preaching and publiſhing of this doctrine of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath done much hurt: and it had been good it had never been knowne to the people, but utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. For ſome it driveth to deſpaire, and others it maketh more ſecure and careleſſe.</hi>

               <p>You are in a great errour: for this doctrine is part of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truth, which hee would have knowne to his people. And in good ſooth, it is of very great and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe to the Children of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the aſſaults of the Divell, and temptations of deſperation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. For when a man hath once
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:175199:175"/> in truth felt, by the effects, that God hath choſen him to life, then though the Divell lye ſore at him, and the conſcience of ſinne and his owne frailties doe vehemently aſſault him; yet he knoweth certainly, that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe and counſell of God is immutable, and that becauſe his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not grounded upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or his owne ſtrength, but upon the unchangeable decree of GOD, which is a foundation immoveable, and alwayes ſtanding ſure and firme: therefore doe the Divell and ſin what they can, yet he ſhall be upheld in righteouſneſſe and truth, and even (as it were) borne up in the armes of God even to the end. For whom God loveth, to the end he loveth them. Moreover, when once the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perceive (by their ſanctification and new birth) both that the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and reprobated ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands, and made choice of them to be heires of his moſt glorious Kingdome, being in themſelves of the ſame mould and making that others are, and that he hath done all this of his free grace and undeſerved mercy towards them: oh how doth it raviſh their hearts with the love of him! Againe, how frankly and cheerfully doe they ſerve him! how willingly and faithfully doe they obey
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:175199:176"/> him! Yea, how are they wholly rapt, and inflamed with the deſire of him! For it is the perſwaſion and feeling of Gods love towards us, that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up our love to him againe; as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>1. John 4. We love him, becauſe he hath love us firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is ſaid of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> that ſhe loved much, becauſe much was forgiven. For after ſhee felt her many &amp; great ſins freely pardoned, her affections were kindled with the love and obedience of Chriſt. So likewiſe the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.5.</note> after ſhee had beene in the banquetting houſe of all ſpirituall grace, and felt the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts love diſplayed upon her, forthwith ſhee was rape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and cryed out (as it were in a ſwoun) that ſhee was ſicke of love. So againe,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.5.</note> when Chriſt put in his hand by the hole of the doore (that is, touched the very inward parts of her heart by his ſpirit) then her heart yearned, and her bowels were affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned towards him. This is it which St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for upon his knees,<note place="margin">Eph. 18, 19</note> that it may be granted to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that they may bee able to comprehend with all the Saints, what is the breadth and length, height and depth of Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and to know the love of Chriſt (which paſſeth knowledge)
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:175199:176"/> and to be filled with all fulneſſe of God. Thus then you ſee the great and comfortable uſe of this doctrine of election, both in that it miniſtreth ſtrength &amp; comfort againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as alſo becauſe it conſtraineth us to love God, and of very love to feare him, and obey him.</p>

Though things be manifeſtly proved to their faces, and both the Chapter and the Verſe ſhewed them, yet will they not beleeve; or though they ſay they beleeve, yet will they never goe about the practice of any thing, but reply againſt God in all their actions. And, for the moſt part, when God ſaith one thing, they will ſay another: when God ſaith yee, they will ſay nay, and ſo give God the lye. Some againe will ſay, If all be true that the Preachers ſay, then God help us. Thus you ſee how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity doth bar men out of Heaven, and caſt them into Hell.</p>

For if God ſhould forthwith ſtrike downe one, and raine fire and brimſtone upon another, and cauſe the earth to ſwallow up a third, then men would feare indeed. But
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:175199:180"/> it hath beene ſhewed before, that God taketh not that courſe, but though he meet with ſome in this life, yet he lets thouſands eſcape; and that makes them more bold, thinking they ſhall never come to their anſwer: even as an old theefe, which hath a long time eſcaped both priſon and gallowes, thinkes he ſhall alwaies ſo eſcape, and therefore goeth boldly on in his thefts. But let men take heed: For, as the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Though the Pitcher goeth long to the Well, yet at laſt it cometh broken home.</hi> So though men eſcape long, yet they ſhall not eſcape alwaies: for there will come a day of reckoning, a day that will pay it home for all. Thus you ſee how impunity leadeth numbers to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that is, when men are let alone, and neither ſmitten by the hand of God, nor puniſhed by the Law of the Magiſtrate.</p>

                  <hi>Let them returne unto thee, but returne not thou unto them.</hi> Vndoubtedly hee is an odde man that is not made worſe with ill company.

His words are theſe, <hi>Mine heart breaketh within mee, becauſe of the Prophets, and all my bones ſhake.</hi> Moreover, in the ſame Chapter is ſet downe how the Lord would feed them with wormwood, and make them drinke the water of gall, and ſundry other wayes plague them for their flatteries, ſeducements, corrupt doctrine, and evill example of life.</p>

They have ſmall cauſe to triumph over us: for thereby their market is never a whit amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Let them take this for anſwer. And let us that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Preachers of the Goſpel, looke narrowly to our ſelves, and make ſtraight ſteps to our feet: for if we tread never ſo little awry, we may ſee how many eyes are upon us. Let us therefore with <hi>David</hi> pray continually, <hi>Order my goings, O Lord, that my foot-ſteps ſlip not: for when my foot ſlipped they rejoyced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee.</hi> And as for the people, let them follow the examples of thoſe which walke unblameably (as God be thanked ſome ſuch there be) and let them flye the examples of ſuch as are offenſive.

Further, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you, whether you did never ſweare by your faith, or troth, or by our Lady St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuch other oathes?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Then you have broken the ſixth Commandement, which chargeth us to avoid wrath, anger, malice, deſire of revenge, and all ſuch like
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:175199:189"/> forerunners unto murder. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, I aske you, whether you did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look upon a woman with a luſt in your heart?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No: thoughts are not free before God; for God knoweth our thoughts, and will puniſh us, arraign us, and condemne us for thoughts. Men know not thoughts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can make not Lawes againſt thoughts: but becauſe God is privie to all our moſt ſecret thoughts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee hath made Lawes againſt them, and will condemne them. Therefore I conclude, that if you have nouriſhed adulterous thoughts in your heart, you are guilty of the breach of the ſeventh commandement, which forbiddeth all ſecret thoughts and provocations whatſoever to adultery. But further, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether you did never pilfer, purloine, and ſteale ſome ſmall things from your neighbour: as paſture, poultry, conies, apples, and ſuch like?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Then have you broken the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:175199:189"/> eight Commandement, and ſtand guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternall death. For God in this Commandement chargeth us to have as great care of our neighbours goods, as of our owne: and not to injure him any manner of way, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thought, word, or deed. Therefore all deceit, pilfring, oppreſſing, and all unjuſt dealing with our neighbours goods, is here condemned. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, let me ask you, whether you did never lie or diſſemble?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Then have you broken the ninth Commandement: wherein God chargeth us, both in witneſſe bearing, and all other matters, to ſpeake the plaine truth from our heart: without lying, or diſſembling.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, I demand, whether you did never in your heart deſire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was not your owne: as your neighbours houſe or ground, kine or ſheepe, &amp;c. therein bewraying the diſcontentment of your heart.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>I am as guilty in this as in any thing: For God forgive me, I have often deſired and luſted after this and that, which was none of mine owne, and ſo have bewrayed my diſcontentment.</hi>

                  <hi>Well: now I do plainly ſee, that I have been deceived, and am not in ſo good eſtate before God, as I thought I had been. Moreover, I ſee that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are out of the way, which thinke they are in a good caſe before God: whereas indeed they are in blindneſſe, and in their ſinnes.

               <p>This is a thing that muſt be exceedingly laboured in of us which are the Miniſters and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel. And here is required diligence, and (as wee ſay) double diligence: for the people are every where very ignorant. Some are ſtones, altogether uncapable of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:175199:198"/> inſtructions: others are froward and wilfull: ſome will receive the doctrine, but not the practice: ſome againe are altogether ſet upon peeviſhneſſe and cavilling. So that a man were better take upon him the charge of keeping Wolves and Beares, then the charge of ſoules. For it is the hardeſt thing in the world to reforme mens diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to bring them into order; to pull mens ſoules out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan, and to bring them to God. It is, as wee ſay, an endleſſe piece of worke, and infinite toile, a labour of all labours: I quake to thinke of it. For men are ſo obſtinate and irrefragable, that they will be brought into no order: they will come under no yoke. They will not be ruled by God, nor bridled by his Word. They will follow their owne ſwinge. They will runne after their owne luſts and pleaſures. They will rage and ſtorme if you goe about to curb them, and reſtraine them of their wills, likings, and liberties. They will have their wills, likings and liberties. They will have their wills, and follow their old faſhions, ſay what you will, and doe what you can.</p>
               <p>Is it not, thinke you, a buſie piece of worke to ſmooth and ſquare ſuch Timber-logs, ſo full of knots and

                  <hi>Well, Sir, you can but doe your endeavour, and commit the ſucceſſe to God. You can but plant and water: let God give the increaſe. You are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Letter; but not of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. You baptize with water; but not with the holy Ghoſt.

For you know what the Lord ſaith by his Prophet,</hi>

               <p>You have ſpoken the truth. And therefore, ſith ſome muſt needs take upon them this ſo great a charge, it will be our beſt courſe, to labour much with them in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, and private inſtructions, and that in moſt familiar and plain
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:175199:199"/> manner. For much good hath beene done, and is done, this way.

Wee muſt not be aſhamed to uſe repetitions and tautologies, an to tell them one thing twenty times over and over againe, here a line and there a line, here a little and there a little, precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: as the Prophet ſpeakes.<note place="margin">Eſay 18.10.</note> I know right well, nothing goes more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtomack of a Scholar, and him that is learned indeed, than to doe thus. It is as irkeſome and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to teach A B C. Some can at no hand endure it. But truely, truely, I finde now, after a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that if wee will doe any good to theſe ſimple and ignorant ſoules, wee muſt enter into this courſe: and wee may not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it. For it will be our crown
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:175199:200"/> and our glory to win ſoules, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee be abaſed. Let us therefore be well content to ſtoop downe, that Chriſt may be exalted: let us be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that God may be honoured: let us doe all things in great love to Chriſt, who hath ſaid, <hi>If thou loveſt mee,</hi>

                  <hi>feed, feed, feed my flocke.</hi> Let us therefore teſtifie our love to him by feeding his flocke. Let us doe all things in great love and deep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards the poore ſoules that goe aſtray: as it is ſaid, that our Lord Ieſus was moved to pitie, and his bowels did yerne to ſee the people as ſheep without a ſhepherd. Let it likewiſe move us throughly, and make our hearts to bleed, to ſee ſo many poore ſheep of Chriſt wandring and ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mountains and wilderneſſe of this world, caught in every bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and hanged in every buſh, ready to be devoured of the Wolfe.

               <p>I told you before that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is good, profitable, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but yet it is not ſufficient. Wee muſt not content our ſelves with that onely, but wee muſt goe further, and get unto our ſelves the ſound preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, as the chiefeſt and moſt principall meanes which God hath ordained and ſanctified for the ſaving of men. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>when as the world (by wiſedome) knew not God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>in the wiſedome of God it pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſave them that beleeve.</hi> The meaning of it is, that when as men, neither by naturall wiſedome nor the contemplation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, could ſufficiently attaine to the true knowledge of God; the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his heavenly and infinite wiſedome thought of another courſe, which is, to ſave men by preaching:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:175199:201"/> which the world counteth fooliſhneſſe. And by the way note, that the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word is not a thing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention, but it is Gods owne device, &amp; came firſt from him, &amp; is the next &amp; neereſt way to ſave mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo in the Booke of the Proverbs telleth us, that the preaching of Gods Word (which hee calleth Viſion, uſing the word of the Prophets, which called their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Viſions) is not a thing that may be ſpared, or that wee may be at our choice whether we have it or no: but he maketh it to be of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity unto eternall life. For he ſaith, <hi>Where Viſion faileth, the people are left naked.</hi> So indeed it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:<note place="margin">Pro. 29.18.</note> but the old Tranſlation giveth us the ſenſe thus, <hi>Wh re the Word of God is not preached, there the people p riſh.</hi> Thus you ſee that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtriketh it dead, telling us, that all they which are without Preaching of the Word, are in exceeding great danger of loſing their ſoules. Oh that men could be perſwaded of this! Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> that faith cometh by hearing the word preached: for hee ſaith, <hi>How can they heare without a Preacher?</hi> If faith cometh by hearing the Word preached, then I reaſon thus: No Preaching, no faith: no faith, no Chriſt: no Chriſt, no eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:175199:202"/> life: for eternall life is only in him. Let us then put them together thus: Take away the Word, take away faith: take away faith, take away Chriſt: take away Chriſt, &amp; take away eternall life. So then it followes: Take away the Word, and take away eternall life.</p>
               <p>Or wee may reade them backward thus: If wee will have heaven, wee muſt have Chriſt: If wee will have Chriſt, wee muſt have faith: If wee will have faith, wee muſt have the Word preached. Then it followeth thus: If wee will have heaven, wee muſt have the word preached. Then I conclude, that preaching generally, and for the moſt part, is of abſolute neceſſity unto eternall life, as meet is of abſolute neceſſity for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies, as graſſe and fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are of abſolute neceſſity for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Thus wee ſee there is no dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; but if wee ſin, wee are as ſure to be jerkt for it as the coate is on our backe. Therefore let us not deceive our ſelves, nor make light of ſinne: for ſin is no ſcar-bug, and wee ſhall one day finde it ſo. And howſoever wee make light of ſome ſins, yet in very deed all ſin is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the ſight of God: yea, all ſin is hainous and capitall in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it is againſt a perſon of infinite being, it is againſt God himſelfe, it is againſt the higheſt Majeſtie. For the greatneſſe of the perſon offended doth inhaunſe and increaſe the greatneſſe of the ſinne.</p>
               <p>As for example: If a man rail at a Juſtice of Peace, he ſhall be ſtocked: if he caſt at one of his Majeſties privy Councell, he ſhall be impriſoned: but if hee raile at his owne Majeſtie, hee
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:175199:208"/> ſhall be hanged. So then you ſee how a ſin is increaſed by the dignity of the perſon offended. Now then, ſith all mortall Princes are but duſt in the ſight of God (and hee is a perſon of infinite and incomparable Majeſtie) how hainous and how ſlagitious a thing is it, in any wiſe, or after any ſort, to ſin againſt his moſt royall and ſacred perſon? Well then, to grow to ſome concluſion, this I doe adviſe you, as to ſhunne all vice, ſo to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all vertue; as to put off the old man, ſo to put on the new man. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member often and alwaies what ſhall become of you after this life, where you ſhall be forty yeers hence in Hell, or Heaven.

For our life ought to be a continuall meditation of death: wee ſhould alwayes live as if wee ſhould dye, or that our bed ſhould be our grave: wee muſt live continually as if Chriſt ſhould come to judgement preſently: as it is reported of a godly man in the Primitive Church, that whether hee ate or dranke, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did, he thought alwayes he heard the Trumpet of the Lord, with theſe words: <hi>Ariſe, yee dead, and come unto Judgement.</hi> Put caſe it were certainly knowne, that Chriſt would come to Iudgement the next Mid-ſummer day; O wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extremitie thereof: it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſpecially in theſe three things: Firſt, that it is a ſeparation from all joy and comfort of the preſence of God. Secondly, that it is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fellowſhip with the Divell and his Angels. Thirdly, it is a feeling of the horrible wrath of God, which ſhall ſeize upon body and ſoule, and ſhall feed on them (as fire doth upon pitch and brimſtone) for ever. The Scriptures doe note the extremity of it, in calling it,<note place="margin">Apoc. 11.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:175199:217"/> wood:</hi> and that <hi>the breath of the Lord, as a river of brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> All theſe things be terrible to our ſenſes: and yet can they not fully expreſſe the thing as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. For no heart can conceive, or tongue expreſſe the greatneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the torments of Hell. As the joyes of Heaven never entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man: no more did the torments of Hell. All the torments and troubles that fall upon men in this life, are but the ſparkles of the furnace of Gods totall wrath. All fires are but as it were pictures of fire, in compariſon of Hell fire. For, as one writeth, Hell fire is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hot, that it will burne up a man ſeven mile before hee come at it. Yet the Reprobates, being alwayes in it, ſhall never be conſumed of it. As the Salamander is alwayes in the fire, and never conſumeth; ſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall be alwayes in the fire of Hell, and never conſume. For Hell is a death alwayes living, and an end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beginning. It is a grievous thing to a man that is very ſicke, to lye long upon a feather bed: how much more upon a hot gridi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on? but how moſt of all to burn alwaies in Hell fire, and never be conſumed? Another extremity of it conſiſteth in this, that the torments of Hell are univerſall:
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:175199:217"/> that is, in every member at once; head, eyes, tongue, teeth, throat, ſtomacke, back, belly, heart, ſides, &amp;c. All puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life are particular: For ſome are pained in their head, ſome in their backe, ſome in their ſtomacke, &amp;c. yet ſome particular paines are ſuch as a man would not ſuffer to gaine all the world. But for a man to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in all parts at once, what ſight more lamentable? who could but take pity of a dog in the ſtreet in that caſe? Thus then we ſee, that the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Hell torments is greater then can be conceived or uttered. For who can utter that which is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? Wee can goe no further in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that which is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, then to know it to be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</p>

               <p>The Scriptures doe ſet forth the perpetuity of Hell torments, in ſaying, they are for ever. The wicked ſhall be caſt into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for ever. The fire never goeth out. When as many hundred thouſand yeares are expired as there be ſtones by the Sea ſide, yet ſtill there be ſo many more to come. For that which hath no end, can never come to an
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:175199:218"/> end. If all the Arithmeticians in the world were ſet a worke to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but number all the dayes of their life, even the greateſt numbers that they could poſſibly ſet downe, and ſhould in the end adde all their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers together, yet could they never come any thing neere to that length of time wherein the wicked ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. If the whole circumference of the Heavens were written about with figures of Arithmeticke, from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from the Weſt to the Eaſt againe; yet could it not containe that infinite time, and innumerable yeeres, wherein all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers ſhall ſuffer eternall torture. For in things infinite, time hath no place. For time is the meaſure of thoſe things which are ſubject to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Therefore becauſe hell torments are infinite, they cannot be meaſured by any time: neither can that which is infinite be diminiſhed. For if you ſubſtract from that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ten thouſand thouſand millions of millions, yet it is thereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminiſhed or made leſſe. Put caſe a man ſhould once in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand yeeres take a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water out of the great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean Sea, how long would it be ere he had ſo emptied it? Yet ſhall a man ſooner empty the Sea, by taking
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:175199:218"/> out a ſpoonfull once in an hundred thouſand yeares, then the damned ſoule ſhall have any eaſe.

O yee carnall worldlings, thinke on this in time. For if you will not now be moved in hearing, you ſhall then be cruſhed in pieces in feeling. What availeth it to live in all poſſible pleaſures, and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights here for ſome ſixty yeares, and then to ſuffer this eternall torment? what ſhall it profit a man to win the whole world, and loſe his ſoule? They be more then mad, which will hazzard their ſoule for a little profit, and a few ſtinking pleaſures. But this is the manner of men: they will have the preſent ſweet (come of it what will) though they pay never ſo deare for it: though they goe to the higheſt price: though they loſe their ſoules for it. Oh the unſpeakable blindneſſe and madneſſe of the men of this world! The Divell hath put out their eyes, and therefore leadeth them whither he liſts. For who cannot lead

                  <hi>What ſhall a man give for the recompence of his ſoule?</hi> Where our Saviour doth plainly affirme, that there is no ranſome or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, though never ſo great, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a damned ſoule. For the ſoule being in Hell, can never be releaſed, it is paſt remedy, no meanes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can doe any good: no gold, no ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, no friends, no riches, no power,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:175199:219"/> no policy, no flattery, no bribery, no reach, no fetch or device whatſoever, can prevaile one jot: for a man being once in Hell hath no remedy, hee is in cloſe priſon, he is ſhut up under the hatches for ever, there is no getting out againe, he muſt ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment. Hee cannot bring a writ of falſe impriſonment, becauſe he is laid in by the moſt righteous and juſt Iudge, who cannot poſſibly doe any wrong; but hee muſt lye by it. For being there once, he is there for ever. If all the Angels of Heaven ſhould intreat for a damned ſoule; if <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould make great ſuit; if all the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſolicitors to Chriſt for releaſe; if the father ſhould make requeſt for his ſon, or the mother for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet can none of theſe be heard, they muſt all have the repuiſe. For the ſentence of Chriſt cannot be reverſed, his decree is unrepealeable. The due conſideration of theſe things may make all hearts to quake, and all knees to tremble. In the troubles and afflictions of this life, though a man come in never ſo great danger, yet hee may wind out againe by one meanes or another, by mony, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or rewards, or ſuch like meanes: but in Hell-fire, this is it that gripes,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:175199:220"/> and maketh the heart deſpaire, that there is no remedy at all to be uſed. If wee ſhould aske of a damned ſoule, or an afflicted conſcience, what they would give for the eaſe and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoules; they would anſwer, the whole world: howſoever ſecure worldlings and wicked Atheiſts (which ſee nothing, or feele nothing) make nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Here, by the way, let us conſider the greatneſſe of the loſſe of a mans ſoule; which we ſhall the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and ſee into, if we can aright value and prize the ſoule. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be demanded, what is the price of the ſoule, or what is it worth? Our Lord Ieſus anſwereth, that it is more worth then all the world. For, ſaith hee,<note place="margin">Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>What ſhall it profit a man <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o win all the world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi> Therefore the ſoule of the pooreſt beggar is more worth then all the world. Then I reaſon thus: If the ſoule be more worth then all the world, then the loſſe of it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the loſſe of the whole world. For indeed it is a loſſe of all loſſes, an unrecoverable loſſe. If a man ſhould have his houſe burnt over his head, and all that hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in one night, it were a great loſſe. If a Merchant-venturer ſhould loſe twenty thouſand pounds
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:175199:220"/> in one venture, in one ſhip, or (as they ſay) in one bottome, it were a very great loſſe. If a King ſhould loſe his Crowne and Kingdome, it were an exceeding great loſſe: But the loſſe of the ſoule is a thouſand times more then all theſe, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infinite importance. If a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be caſt out of the favour of his Land-lord, it is a matter of griefe. If a Noblemans Secretary be caſt out of favour with his Lord, ſo that he taketh a pritch againſt him, it is a matter of great ſorrow. If a Nobleman himſelfe be diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and caſt out of all favour with his Prince, that was in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it is a corſie, a heart-ſmart, and a matter of exceeding grievance. But to be eternally ſeparated from God, to be ſhut out of his favour, and to be caſt away from his preſence, and the preſence of his Angels, is a matter of infinite more dolour and torment. Marke then and behold what a thing it is for a man to loſe his ſoule. Oh therefore that men would be wiſe in Gods feare, that they would looke out in time, and make proviſion for their ſoules. Now then, to cloſe up this whole point: the ſumme of all that hath been ſaid is this, That the torments of Hell are endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe.</p>

Apply Chriſt, apply his merits, apply the promiſes to your ſelfe, and to your owne conſcience, ſo ſhall they doe you good, and bring great comfort to your ſoule.

Even ſo the righteouſneſſe and merits of Chriſt are a ſpirituall ſalve, which will cure any wound of the ſoule: but if wee doe not apply them
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:175199:225"/> to our ſoules by faith, they can doe us no good. You muſt therefore apply Chriſt, and all the promiſes of the Goſpel, to your ſelfe by faith, and ſtand fully perſwaded, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee hath done upon the Croſſe, hee hath done for you particularly. For what is juſtifying faith, but a full perſwaſion of Gods particular love to us in Chriſt? The generall and confuſed knowledge of Chriſt and his Goſpel availes not to eternall life. Labour therefore to have the true uſe of all theſe great and precious promiſes, and ſticke faſt to Chriſt: for through him onely wee have remiſſion of ſins, and eternall life.<note place="margin">Acts 10.45.</note> 
                  <hi>To him all the Prophets give witneſſe</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter) that through his Name all that beleeve ſhall receive remiſſion of their ſins.</hi> Where the Apoſtle tells us, that if a great Iury of Prophets were pannelled to teſtifie of the way and meanes to eternall life, they would all, with one conſent, bring in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that remiſſion of ſins and eternall life are onely in Chriſt. Let us heare the Fore-man ſpeake, and one or two of the reſt: for in the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall every word ſtand. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 54.5.</note> 
                  <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:175199:226"/> him, and with his ſtripes wee are healed.</hi> This great Prophet we ſee plainly affirmes, that Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins, and by his ſuffering we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> teſtifies the ſame thing,<note place="margin">Jer. 23 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>Behold, the day is come (ſaith the Lord) that I will raiſe to <hi>David</hi> a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reigne and proſper, and ſhall execute judgement and juſtice in the earth. In his dayes <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is the name whereby they ſhall call him, The Lord our righteouſneſſe.</hi> This Prophet jumps with the other. For he ſaith, that Chriſt is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous branch, and that he is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: which is all one, as if hee had ſaid, our ſinnes are pardoned onely through him, and through him we are made righteous. Moreover hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Church, ſhall be ſaved by him. The Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> that I may ſpeake it with reverence, telleth the ſame tale word for word. He avoucheth the ſame thing with the other two Prophets: for hee ſaith, <hi>In that day a fountaine ſhall be opened to the houſe of <hi>David,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and to the inhabitants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, for ſinne, and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> The meaning of the Prophet is, that in the dayes of Chriſts Kingdome, the fountaine of Gods mercy in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:175199:226"/> Chriſt, ſhould be opened and let-out to waſh away the ſinnes and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church. So then we ſee, that theſe three great witneſſes doe all agree in this, that through Chriſt onely we are waſhed from our ſinnes, and through him onely wee are made righteous. Seeing then that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is onely in the Sonne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that hath the Sonne, hath life. Be of good courage therefore, O <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunetus:</hi> for no doubt you have the Sonne, and therefore eternall life. Feare not your ſinnes, for they cannot hurt you: for as all the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the moſt righteous men that ever lived on the face of the earth, if it were yours, could doe you no good without Chriſt: ſo all the ſinne in the world can doe you no hurt, being in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>For there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Plucke up a good heart therefore: be no more heavie and ſad: for if you be found in Chriſt, clothed with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſſe (being made yours through faith) what can the Divell ſay to you? what can the Law doe? They may well hiſſe at you, but they cannot ſting you: they may grin at you, but they cannot hurt you. For who ſhal lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?

Moreover, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to be perſwaded, that Gods mercy is exceeding great towards pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners, and all ſuch as mourne for their tranſgreſſions: according as hee ſaith, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart,</hi> hee <hi>will put them

For as high as the heaven is above the earth, ſo great is his mercy towards thoſe that feare him. As farre as is the Eaſt from the Weſt, ſo farre hath hee removed our ſinnes from us. As a Father hath compaſsion on his children, ſo hath the Lord compaſsion on them that feare him. For he knowes whereof wee be made, he remembreth that wee are but duſt.</hi> The Hiſtory of the loſt ſonne doth moſt notably ſet forth the wonderfull mercy of God towards penitent ſinners.

Even ſo the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father doth rejoyce at the converſion of any of his loſt ſonnes. Yea, there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God for one ſinner that converteth.

He is that Pelican, who by pecking a hole in his owne breaſt, doth reſtore his young to life againe by his bloud. Yet one thing wee muſt note by the way, which hath been partly touched before, That all the mercies of God, and merits of Chriſt, are to be reſtrained only to the Elect, only to the true members of the Church; as plainly appeareth in <hi>Pſal. 103.</hi> where the mercies of God, which are there
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:175199:229"/> largely deſcribed, are reſtrained onely to them that feare him, keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and thinke upon his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to doe them. And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt it is ſaid, that hee is a Prince and a Saviour unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he ſhall redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his iniquities. Againe it is written,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.</note> that Chriſt being conſecrate, was made the <hi>Authour of eternall ſalvation to them that obey him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.6.</note> None doe or can obey him but only the Elect, therefore hee is the Authour of ſalvation onely to the Elect. And conſequently, the profane world, whatſoever they ſay, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they brag and boaſt, have no true title, or intereſt in him. This thing was figured in the Law, in this, that the Mercy-ſeat, which was a type of Gods mercy in Chriſt; and the Arke, which was a figure of the Church, were, by the expreſſe commandement of GOD, fitted each to other,<note place="margin">Exod. 25.10.</note> both in length and breadth. For as the Arke was two cubits and a halfe long, and a cubit and a halfe broad; juſt ſo was the Mercy-ſeat. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby, that the mercy of God in Chriſt ſhould onely be fitted to his Church, and belong onely to the Church; ſo as not one without the Church ſhould be ſaved. For hee that hath not the Church for his Mother, cannot have God for his
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:175199:230"/> Father. Laſtly, we are to obſerve, that as God is infinite in mercy, and of great compaſſion toward penitent ſinners: ſo alſo is hee moſt conſtant in the courſe of his mercies towards his children. And therefore one of the Pſalmes carries this foot,<note place="margin">Pſal. 156.</note> 
                  <hi>His mercie endureth for ever, his mercie endureth for ever, his mercie endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever.</hi> Noting thereby both the conſtancie and eternitie of Gods mercy.

                  <hi>It is the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that wee are not conſumed, it is becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</hi> Let us know therefore that God, as touching his mercy to his children, is of a moſt conſtant and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature. As hee ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> For if GOD were of a changeable nature, as we are, and ſubject to paſſions, then were wee in a moſt miſerable caſe, then muſt hee needs ſmite us downe, and take vengeance of us every day, and every houre in the day, becauſe wee provoke him every day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houre in the day. But the God of Heaven is not as a man, that hee ſhould be ſubject to paſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: hee is of a moſt conſtant and immutable nature. For though we provoke him every day with new ſins, yet is he ſo farre off from take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:175199:230"/> revenge, that the next day hee rewardeth us with new mercies, and breaketh through all our unkindneſſe to ſhew kindneſſe unto us; and through all our naughtineſſe to doe us good. All our infirmities cannot make him breaks off with us, or ceaſe to love us. Hee is content to take us with all faults, and to love us dearly, though wee have great faults. Hee regardeth not our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: though wee be oftentimes wayward and elviſh, yet for all that hee loveth us nevertheleſſe. Even as a loving Mother, though her young ſuckling cry all the night, and be exceeding treaſe and wayward, ſo as ſhee cannot reſt on houre in the night; yea, though ſhee endure much lothſomeneſſe and trouble with it, yet in the morning when ſhee riſeth ſhee loveth it never the leſſe, but dand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, playeth with it, ſmileth and laugheth upon it: ſo the God of all mercies, whoſe love towards us farre paſſeth the love of mothers, though we grieve him with our infirmities conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, yet loveth us nevertheleſſe, and is content to put up all, to forget and forgive all; for hee is a moſt conſtant lover. Where he once ſets and ſettles his love, hee loveth moſt conſtantly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can alter him, nothing can remove him. Even as a Father, when his
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:175199:231"/> little childe catcheth a fall, breaketh his ſhinnes, and hurteth his face, is ſo farre from beeing offended or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him therefore, that hee doth pity him and bemoane him, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedies for his hurt: ſo our mercifull Father is ſo farre off from being angry and diſpleaſed with us for ſome ſlips and falls, that hee doth the more pitie us, and lament our caſe. Even as a loving, and wiſe husband, although his wife have many infirmities, yet being aſſured ſhee loves him dearly, and that her heart is with him, hee is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to winke at all her faults, to hide them, to beare with them; yea, and to make nothing of them; loving her no whit the leſſe for them: ſo our deare husband and Spouſe, Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe hee knoweth wee love him, and that hee hath our hearts, is content to beare with all our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and to make light of them.

For, as hee that beholdeth any thing through a red glaſſe, doth take it to be red, as is the colour of the glaſſe: ſo God the Father, beholding us in his Sonne, doth take us to be of the ſame nature and quality that hee is; that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous. For this cauſe it is that hee loveth us, and ſetteth his heart upon us, and will not be remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us. For his love to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is alwaies one and the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have alwaies the like ſight and feeling of it; as the Moone is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſame in ſubſtance and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, though ſometimes it ſeemeth unto us to be waſted into a very ſmall ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Let us know then, to our great comfort, that the love of God towards us, in his deare Sonne, is conſtant, and alwaies alike: and that he will not diſcountenance us, or ſhake us off for ſome infirmities, no nor yet for many infirmities: for the mercifull God doth accept of his children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their generall care is good, and the univerſall tenour of their life tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto righteouſneſſe howſoever they may greatly faile in many particular actions. Two or three fits of an ague doe not prove a diſeaſed body; nor two or three good daies a found

                  </gap> men are truely ſaid to walke in a way, when they go in it, although ſometimes they trip and ſtumble: ſo Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do walk in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, although ſometimes they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſtep out of it, or ſometimes be violently haled out of it by theeves. For Satan and the violence of our luſts do often hale us out of the way: but wee muſt get into it againe as ſoon as wee are eſcaped. Now then, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and draw to an end: Sith God is ſo infinitely mercifull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his mercy: ſith ſuch great and precious promiſes are made to us in Chriſt: ſith the Lord doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our infirmities when our hearts are with him: therefore, O <hi>Aſune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> be of good cheere, let nothing trouble you; feare not the aſſaults of the Divel, regard not his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for aſſuredly your ſinnes are forgiven. Chriſt is yours: heaven is yours: and all the promiſes of life and ſalvation belong unto you. So as you need not doubt; you cannot miſcarry: your name is written in the Book of life.</p>

                  <hi>I am greatly comforted and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:175199:232"/> cheered up with your words. Your preaching of the Goſpel, and laying open of Gods abundant mercy in Chriſt, and of the promiſes, doe exceedingly revive me, and even as it were put new life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: they are as Sacke and Sugar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoule, and ſweeter then the honey and the honey-combe: they are as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to my ſicke ſoule, and as ointment to my ſpirituall wounds. I do now begin to ſee what miſery is in man, and what mercy is in God. And I know by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience, that where miſery is not felt, there mercy is not regarded: but now it hath pleaſed God to give mee ſome feeling of mine owne wretchedneſſe and miſery, and yet with good comfort in his mercy. For I thanke God for it, I begin now to grow to ſome perſwaſion, that the promiſes do belong unto me, my ſins are forgiven, and that I am one of them that ſhall be ſaved.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Lord our God, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, we thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy children do here come into thy moſt holy and heavenly preſence, to give thee praiſe and glory for all thy great mercies and manifold bleſſings toward us, eſpecially for that thou haſt preſerved us this night paſt from all the dangers and fears thereof, haſt given us quiet reſt to our bodies, and brought us now ſafely to the beginning of this day, and doſt now afreſh renew all thy mercies upon us, as the Eagle reneweth her bill; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us all things abundantly to enjoy, as food, raiment, health, peace, liberty, and freedome from many miſeries, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, caſualties, and calamities which we are ſubject to in this life every minute of an houre: and not onely ſo, but alſo for vouchſafing unto us many good things, not onely for neceſsity, but even for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light alſo. But above all (dear Father) wee praiſe thy name for the bleſsings of a better life, eſpecially for thy moſt holy Word and Sacraments, and all the good wee enjoy thereby; for the continuance of the Goſpel amongſt us, for the death of thy Sonne, and all that happineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:175199:238"/> which wee have thereby; alſo becauſe thou haſt choſen us to life before wee were, and that of thy meere goodneſſe and undeſerved favour toward us; and haſt called us in thine appointed time, juſtified us by thy grace, and ſanctified us by thy Spirit, and adopted us to be thine owne children, and heires apparent to the great Crowne. O Lord, open our eyes every day more and more, to ſee and conſider of thy great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous love to us in all theſe things; that by the due conſideration thereof, our hearts may be drawne yet neerer unto thee, even more to love thee, feare thee, and obey thee: that as thou art enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged towards us in mercy, ſo we may be enlarged towards thee in thankſgiving: and as thou doſt abound towards us in goodneſſe, ſo we may abound towards thee in obedience and love. And ſith (deare Father) thou art never weary of doing us good, notwithſtanding all our unworthineſſe and naughtineſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the conſideration of thy great mercy and fatherly kindneſſe towards us, even as it were force our hearts, and compell us to come into thy moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence, with new ſongs of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving in our mouthes. Wee pray thee (O moſt mercifull God) to forgive all our unthankfulneſſe, unkindneſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe, and great abuſing of all thy mercies, and eſpecially our abuſe and
<pb facs="tcp:175199:238"/> contempt of thy Goſpel, together with all other the ſinnes of our life, which we confeſſe are innumerable, and more then can be reckoned up, both in omiſſion of good things, and commiſſion of evill. We moſt humbly entreat thee to ſet them all over to the reckoning which thy Son Chriſt hath made up for them upon his Croſſe, and never to lay any of them to our charge, but freely forget all, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all. Naile down all our ſinnes and iniquities to the Croſſe of Chriſt, bury them in his death, bathe them in his bloud, hide them in his wounds, let them never riſe up in judgement againſt us. Set us free of the miſeries that are upon us for ſin, and keep back the judgements to come, both of ſoule, body, goods, and good name. Be reconciled unto us in thy deare Sonne concerning all matters paſt, not once remembring or repeating unto us our old and abominable iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but accept us as righteous in him, imputing his righteouſneſſe to us, and our ſins to him. Let his righteouſneſſe ſatisfie thy juſtice for all our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, his obedience for our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his perfection for our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover, wee humbly beſeech thy good Majeſty to give us the true ſight and feeling of our manifold ſins, that we may not be blinded in them through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or hardened in them through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as the reprobates are: but that we
<pb facs="tcp:175199:239"/> may be even weary of them, and much grieved for them, labouring and ſtriving by all poſſible meanes to get out of them. Good Father, touch our hearts with true repentance for all ſinne. Let not us take any delight or pleaſure in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne, but howſoever we fall through frailty (as wee fall often) let us never fall finally, let us never lye downe in ſin, nor continue in ſin: but let us get up on our feet againe, and turne to thee with all our hearts, and ſeek thee whileſt thou maiſt be found, and whileſt thou doſt offer grace and mercy unto us. O Lord, increaſe in us that true and lively faith, whereby wee may lay ſure hold on thy Sonne Chriſt, and reſt upon his merits altogether. Give us faith aſſuredly to beleeve all thy great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made in the Goſpel, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us from above to walk and abound in all the true and ſound fruits of faith. Let us walke, not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Let us feele the power of thy Sonnes death killing ſin in our mortall bodies, and the power of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection raiſing us up to newneſſe of life. Let us grow daily in the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and the mortification of the fleſh. Let us live holily, juſtly, and ſoberly in this preſent evill world, ſhewing forth the vertues of thee in all our particular actions, that wee may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne our moſt holy profeſſion, and
<pb facs="tcp:175199:239"/> ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked and froward generation amongſt whom wee live, being gainfull to all by our lives and converſation, and offenſive to none. To this end wee pray thee fill us with thy Spirit, and all ſpirituall graces, as love, wiſdome, patience, contentment, meekneſſe, humility, temperance, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, kindneſſe, and affability, and ſtirre us up to uſe prayer and watchfulneſſe, reading and meditation in thy Law, and all other good meanes whereby wee may grow and abound in all heavenly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Bleſſe us in the uſe of the meanes from day to day, make us ſuch as thou wouldeſt have us to be, and ſuch as wee deſire to be: worke in us both will and deed, purpoſe and power: For thou, O Lord, art all in all, thou wilt have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon whom thou wilt have mercie, and whom thou wilt thou hardeneſt. Have mercy upon us therefore (deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and never leave us to our ſelves, nor to our owne wills, luſts, and deſires, but aſſiſt us with thy good Spirit, that we may continue to the end in a righteous courſe; that ſo at length wee may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into glory, and be partakers of that immortall Crowne which thou haſt laid up for all that love thee, and truly call upon thee.</p>
            <p>Further, wee intreat thee, O heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, to give us all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this life: as food, raiment, health,
<pb facs="tcp:175199:240"/> peace, liberty, and ſuch freedome from thoſe manifold miſeries which we lie open unto every day, as thou ſeeſt meet. Bleſſe unto us all the meanes which thou haſt put into our hands for the ſuſtenance of this fraile life. Bleſſe our flocke and ſtore, corne and cattell, trades and occupations, and all workes of our hands: for thy bleſſing onely makes rich, and it bringeth no ſorrowes with it. Give us therefore ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencie and ſufficiencie of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings, as thou in thy heavenly wiſdome ſeeſt moſt needfull for us. Moreover, wee humbly beſeech thee (moſt loving Father) in great mercie looke downe from Heaven upon thy whole Church, and every member of it. Be favourable unto Sion, and build up the walls of Jeruſalem. Behold with the eye of pitie, the great ruines and deſolation of thy Church. Heale up the wounds, and make up the breaches thereof in all Nations. Regard it as thine own flocke, tender it as thine own family, dreſſe it as thine owne Vineyard, love it as thine owne Spouſe. Thinke thoughts of peace to it, and alwayes looke upon it in deep compaſſion. Bleſſe it with thy grace, guide it with thy Spirit, and defend it ſtill with thy mighty power: ſcatter the devices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound the counſels, and overthrow the forces of all that fight againſt it. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:175199:240"/> wee intreat thee, deare Father, to ſet thy ſelfe againſt that Antichriſt of Rome, that man of perdition, which ſetteth himſelfe againſt thee, and againſt all thy people. In thine appointed time wee pray thee give him a deadly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall: Beat downe all his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority daily more and more; give free paſſage to thy Goſpel in all Kingdomes, that Babylon may fall, and never riſe up againe. The more the favourites and adherents of Rome labour to uphold their Idolatrous Kingdome, the more let it fall downe, even as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the preſence of thine Arke. Poure downe the Vials of the fulneſſe of thy wrath upon the Kingdomes of the Beaſt; and let their riches, wealth, credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority dry up every day more and more, as the river Euphrates. Let it pitie thee, O Father, to ſee thine owne Spouſe ſit as a deformed and forlorne woman here below, weeping and mourning with her haire about her necke, having loſt all her beauty and comelineſſe: Cheere her up (deare Father) glad her with the joy of thy countenance, and ſo decke her, and trim her up, that thou maiſt delight in her as a Bridegroome in his Bride. Specially wee intreat thee have mercie upon thy Church in this Land: intend good unto us, and not evill: Give us not over into the hands of our cruell enemies, as our ſinnes have deſerved.
<pb facs="tcp:175199:241"/> Scatter we pray thee, O Lord, the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and breake the plots of all ſuch as have plotted the overthrow and utter ſubverſion of this Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Bleſſe this Church more and more with the continuance of true Religion amongſt us: for thy great Names ſake, and infinite mercies ſake, deale graciouſly and favourably with us and our poſterity. Turne from us that vengeance which is due unto us for our ſinnes. For thou ſeeſt how iniquity prevaileth, and the wicked goe away with the goale. Atheiſme over-ſpreadeth every where, and Popery ſeemeth to get a head againe. Now therefore (deare Father) we moſt humbly beſeech thee to take order ſpeedily for the remedying and repreſſing of theſe manifold diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and grievous enormities that are amongſt us. Be intreated of thy poore children to be good to this Engliſh Nation. Heare the cries of thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: heare the mourning of them that mourne in Sion. Let the cries of thy children cry downe all the cries of the ſins of the Land, and be reconciled unto us in the multitude of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions; that ſo thou maiſt ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a moſt mercifull protectour of this thine Engliſh Vineyard. Wee pray thee (good Father) ſhew ſpeciall mercy to our moſt Noble and gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> thine anointed Servant, bleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:175199:241"/> him and keep him in all his wayes, bleſſe his government unto us. Let thine Angels encamp about him, and let thy holy hand be alwayes over him keep him from treaſons, and deliver him from the treacheries of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: give him to ſee what belongs to his peace, and give <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Bleſſe his Majeſties moſt honourable privie Counſellours, and give ſuch good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto all their counſels and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies in matters of State, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty. Bleſſe all the Nobility, worke in them a care to glorifie thy Name in their places; make them faithfull to thee, and faithfull to the Land. Direct with thy good Spirit all ſuch as beare the ſword of Juſtice, that they may draw it out to puniſh the wicked, and to defend the godly, and that they may with all good care and conſcience diſcharge the duties of their places. Increaſe the number of faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:175199:242"/> and zealous Miniſters in this Church. Send thy Goſpel to thoſe places where it is not, and bleſſe it where it is. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them in thy mercy, O Lord, that are under any croſſe or affliction whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: be comfortable unto them, heale up their wounds, bind up their ſores, put all their teares into <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Keep us from all evill, watch over us for our good, let thine Angels encamp about us, let thy holy hand be over us, and keep us in all our waies, that we may live to thy praiſe and glory here on earth, keeping faith and a good conſcience in all our actions; that after this life wee may be crowned of thee for ever in thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

Give us faith (good Father) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to beleeve all the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel, touching remiſſion of ſin, and eternall life, made in thy Sonne Chriſt. O Lord increaſe our faith, that wee may altogether reſt upon thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are all Yea and Amen.

Amend our great imperfections, renew us inwardly more and more, repaire the ruines of our hearts, aide us againſt the remnants of ſin. Enlarge our hearts to run the way of thy Commandements, direct all our ſteps in thy Word, let none iniquity have dominion over us. Aſſiſt us againſt our ſpeciall infirmities and maſter-ſins, that we may get the victory over them all, to thy glory, and the great peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our owne conſciences.

Therefore, deare Father, woe moſt humbly intreat thee, for thy great Names ſake, and for thy infinite mercies ſake, that thou wouldeſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to this Land, and diſcharge it of all the horrible ſins thereof. Drown them, O Lord, in thy infinite mercy through Chriſt, as it were in a bottomleſſe gulfe, that they may never riſe up in judgement againſt us. For although our ſins be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many and fearfull, yet thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is farre greater. For thou art infinite in mercy, but wee cannot be infinite in ſinning. Give us not over into the hands of the Idolaters, leſt they ſhould blaſpheme thy Name, and ſay, Where is their God in whom they truſted? But rather, deare Father, take us into thine owne hands, and correct us according to thy wiſdome: for with thee is mercie and deep compaſſion. Moreover, wee moſt heartily beſeech thy good Majeſtie
<pb facs="tcp:175199:246"/> to bleſſe our moſt gracious Soveraigne King <hi>Charles,</hi> Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the reſt of the Royall Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. We beſeech thee alſo to bleſſe his Majeſties moſt honourable privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, counſell them from above, let them take advice of thee in all things, that they may both conſult and reſolve of ſuch courſes as may be moſt for thy glory, the good of the Church, and peace of this our Common-wealth. Bleſſe the Nobility, and all the Magiſtrates of the Land, giving them all grace to execute judgement and juſtice, and to maintaine truth and equitie. Bleſſe all the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel, increaſe the number of them, increaſe thy gifts in them, and ſo bleſſe all their labours in their ſeverall places and congregations, that they all may be inſtruments of thy hand to enlarge thy Sons Kingdome, and to win many unto thee. Comfort the comfortleſſe with all needfull comforts. Forget none of thine that are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but as their afflictions are, ſo let the joyes and comforts of thy Spirit be unto them, and ſo ſanctifie unto all thine their afflictions and troubles, that they may tend to thy glory, and their owne good. Give us thankfull hearts for all thy mercies both ſpirituall and corporall, for thou art very mercifull unto us in the things of this life, and infinitely more mercifull in the things of a better
<pb facs="tcp:175199:247"/> life. Let us deeply ponder and weigh all thy particular favours toward us, that by the due conſideration thereof our hearts may be gained yet neerer unto thee, and that therefore we may both love and obey thee, becauſe thou art ſo kind and loving unto us: that even thy love towards us may draw our love towards thee, and that becauſe mercy is with thee thou maiſt be feared. Grant theſe things, good Father, and all other needfull gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for our ſoules or bodies, or any of thine throughout the whole world, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake: in whoſe Name wee further call upon thee as he hath taught us in his Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>O</hi> Lord my God and heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I thy moſt unworthy childe do here in thy ſight freely confeſſe that I am a moſt ſinfull creature, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tranſgreſſour of all thy holy Lawes and Commandements: that as I was born and bred in ſin, and ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the womb, ſo have I continually brought forth the corrupt and ugly fruits of that infection and contagion, wherein I was firſt conceived, both in thoughts, words, and workes: If I ſhould goe about to reckon up my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular offences, I knew not where to begin, or where to make an end. For they are more then the haires of my head; yea, far more then I can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly feele or know. For who knoweth the height and depth of his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Who knoweth how oft he offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Thou only, O Lord, knoweſt my ſins, who knoweſt my heart; nothing is hid from thee: thou knoweſt what I have been, and what I am: yea, my conſcience doth accuſe mee of many and grievous evils, and I doe daily feele by wofull experience how fraile I am, how prone to evill, and how untoward unto all goodneſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:175199:248"/> My mind is full of vanity, my heart full of profaneneſſe, mine affections full of deadneſſe, dulneſſe, drowſineſſe in matters of thy worſhip and ſervice: Yea, my whole ſoule is full of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blindneſſe, hardneſſe, unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, coldneſſe, and ſecurity. And in very deed, I am altogether a lump of ſin, and a maſſe of all miſery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have forfeited thy favour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred thy high diſpleaſure, and have given thee juſt cauſe to frowne upon me, to give me over, and leave me to mine own corrupt will and affections. But (O my deare Father) I have learned from thy mouth that thou art a God full of mercy, ſlow to wrath, of great compaſſion and kindneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſuch as groane under the burthen of their ſins. Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy great mercy towards me poor ſinner, and give me a generall pardon for all mine offences whatſoever: ſeale it in the bloud of thy Son, and ſeale it to my conſcience by thy Spirit, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me more and more of thy love and favour towards me, and that thou art a reconciled Father unto me. Grant that I may all time to come love thee much, becauſe much is given, and of very love feare thee, and obey thee. O Lord, increaſe my faith, that I may ſtedfaſtly beleeve all the promiſes of the Goſpel made in thy Son Chriſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:175199:248"/> reſt upon them altogether. Enable me to bring forth the ſound fruits of faith and repentance in all my particular actions. Fill my ſoule full of joy and peace in beleeving. Fill me full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort and ſpirituall ſtrength againſt all temptations: give me yet a greater feeling of thy love and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies towards me; work in my ſoule a love of thy Majeſty, a zeale of thy glory, and hatred of evill, and a deſire of all good things. Give mee victory over thoſe ſinnes which thou knoweſt are ſtrongeſt in me. Act me once at laſt make a conqueſt of the world and the fleſh. Mortifie in mee whatſoever is carnall: ſanctifie mee throughout by thy Spirit: knit my heart to thee for ever, that I may feare thy Name: renue in mee the Image of thy Son Chriſt daily more and more. Give mee a delight in the reading and meditation of thy Word. Let me rejoyce in the publike Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof. Let me love and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence all the faithfull Miniſters of thy Goſpel. Sanctifie their doctrines to my conſcience, ſeale them in my ſoule, write them in my heart; give me a ſoft and melting heart, that I may tremble at thy words, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes much affected with godly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Let not my ſins hold back thy mercies from me, nor mine unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:175199:249"/> ſtop the paſſage of thy grace. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mine eyes to ſee the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of thy Law. Reveale thy ſecrets unto me: be open-hearted toward mee thy unworthy ſervant. Hide nothing from me that may make for thy glory, and the good of my ſoule. Bleſſe all meanes unto me which thou uſeſt for my good. Bleſſe all holy inſtructions unto my ſoule. Bleſſe me at all times, both in hearing and reading thy Word. Give me the right uſe of all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Let my heart be very neerly knit unto them, that where thou loveſt moſt, there I may love moſt alſo. Let me watch and pray, that I enter not into temptation: give mee patience and contentment in all things. Let me love thee more and more, and the worldleſſe and leſſe. So draw my mind upward, that I may deſpiſe all tranſitory things. Let mee be ſo rapt and raviſhed with the ſight and feeling of Heavenly things, that I may make a baſe reckoning of all earthly things. Let me uſe this world as though I uſed it not. Let me uſe it but for neceſſity, as meat and drinke. Let me not be carried away with the vaine pleaſures and fond delights thereof. Good Father, worke the good worke in me, and never leave
<pb facs="tcp:175199:249"/> mee nor forſake mee till thou haſt brought mee to true happineſſe. Oh deare Father, make mee faithfull in my calling, that I may ſerve thee in it, and be alwayes carefull to doe what good I may in any thing. Bleſſe me in my outward eſtate. Bleſſe my ſoule, body, goods, and name. Bleſſe all that belong unto mee. Bleſſe my goings out and comings in. Let thy countenance be lifted up upon mee now and alwayes, cheere me up with the joyes and comforts of thy Spirit: make me thankfull for all thy mercies. For I muſt needs confeſſe that thou art very kind to mee in all things. For in thee I live, move, and have my being; of thee I have my welfare and good being; thou art a daily friend and ſpeciall good benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour unto mee. I live at thy coſt and charges, I hold all of thee in chiefe, and I find that thou art never weary of doing me good: thy goodneſſe towards me is unchangeable. Oh, I can never be thankfull enough unto thee for all thy mercies both ſpirituall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. But in ſuch meaſure as I am able I praiſe thy Name for all, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to accept of my thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in thy Son Chriſt; and to give me a profitable uſe of all thy favours, that thereby my heart may be fully drawne unto thee: give me, O Father,

Pardon all mine unthankfulneſſe, unkindneſſe, and great abuſing of thy mercies, and give me grace to uſe them more to thy glory in all time to come. Strengthen me, deare Father, thus to continue praiſing and glorifying thy Name here upon earth, that after this life I may be crowned of thee for ever in thy Kingdome. Grant theſe petitions, moſt mercifull God, not onely to mee, but to all thy deare children through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake: in whoſe name I doe further call upon thee, ſaying as he hath taught mee; <hi>O our Father, which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
